# Qualitative Research & User Interviews

Video ID: `RotyO-NP7TY`

## Summary
This video emphasizes the critical importance of continuously talking to users for business success, outlining two main types of qualitative research: generative (understanding problems and needs) and evaluative (testing solutions for usability). It details a structured, multi-phase user research process – from designing research questions and recruiting participants to conducting interviews and analyzing results – offering practical advice for both ad-hoc deep dives and continuous discovery. The speaker also provides crucial interviewing techniques to overcome inherent human biases and extract reliable, actionable insights.

## Key insights
- **User-centricity is paramount:** Talking to users is a core function at every business stage, essential for understanding customer needs, validating solutions, and ensuring product-market fit.
- **Two main types of research:** Generative research focuses on discovering user problems and needs (e.g., "jobs to be done"), while evaluative research tests the usability and effectiveness of specific solutions or prototypes.
- **Structured research process:** Effective user research follows a process including designing hypotheses, recruiting diverse users, screening for relevance, scheduling interviews, conducting them skillfully, and thoroughly analyzing and sharing findings.
- **Continuous discovery vs. ad-hoc research:** While ad-hoc research allows for deep, structured investigations, continuous discovery integrates regular, informal user feedback into daily operations for faster iteration and a constant pulse on user needs.
- **Interview best practices:** Overcome the unreliability of human memory by asking for specific past actions, staying neutral, talking as little as possible, and relentlessly digging deeper into details, rather than focusing on hypothetical future actions or opinions about your product.
- **Efficient recruitment and logistics:** Automating recruitment, screening, and scheduling (e.g., using surveys and tools like Calendly) is crucial to overcome common barriers and ensure a steady flow of user interviews for the entire organization.
- **Actionable analysis and sharing:** Research insights are only valuable if used. Implement research repositories and share findings quickly and broadly (e.g., via Slack or email highlights) to ensure the entire company is infused with customer understanding and can act upon the insights.
