## Summary
This video, "ChatGPT Power Skills," by Ed from Hustlebatcher, explores essential techniques for effectively using large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude. It covers principles for using LLMs as a thought partner, smart ways to provide context, efficient input/output methods, and strategies for automating repeat tasks. The aim is to enhance user output quality and speed by leveraging LLMs strategically rather than just asking for direct answers.

## Key insights
-   **Use LLMs as a sparring partner, not a magic answer box:** Instead of asking for a direct solution, use LLMs to generate options, challenge your ideas, critique your work, and augment your thinking for faster, higher-quality results.
-   **Structure complex tasks with plans and step-by-step iteration:** Break down large problems into a high-level plan and then walk through each step individually, providing feedback at each stage to keep the LLM focused and prevent it from veering off track. This "ping-pong method" between the LLM and other tools is highly effective.
-   **Provide optimal context efficiently:** Leverage "context loading" by giving LLMs links or asking them about a topic to quickly seed the conversation. Use "context pulling" by having the LLM ask *you* clarifying questions to gather necessary information, which is faster and less cognitively demanding than preemptively explaining everything.
-   **Utilize diverse input methods for speed and accuracy:** Employ voice input for faster communication and to allow LLMs to process unstructured thoughts more effectively. Use image input (screenshots, photos) to quickly provide visual context, debug problems, or share examples without extensive typing.
-   **Refine outputs and automate repeat tasks:** Use the "canvas" feature (in ChatGPT) to make direct, granular edits to LLM-generated text, ensuring the final output matches your exact needs and style. For recurring tasks, create Custom GPTs or organized "projects" (folders with attached files) to save prompts and persistent context, standardizing and accelerating workflows.
