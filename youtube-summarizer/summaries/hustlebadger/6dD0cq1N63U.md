# Claude Code: Set up your personal knowledge management system

Video ID: `6dD0cq1N63U`

## Summary
This video outlines how to set up a personal knowledge management (PKM) system using AI, primarily Claude Code, to enhance productivity and automate information processing. Dave, the presenter, demonstrates how to leverage voice-to-text interaction, advanced prompt engineering techniques, and a self-learning AI system within Cursor (an AI-native IDE) to manage and derive insights from personal and external data. The core idea is to build a dynamic system that continuously learns, improves, and automates tasks through intelligent agents and integrations.

## Key insights
- **Prioritize Voice-to-Text for Efficiency:** Typing is slow; using voice-to-text tools like FlowVoice.ai significantly accelerates interaction with AI, building a more natural relationship and improving overall efficiency.
- **"Flip the Script" in Prompt Engineering:** Design prompts that make the AI ask clarifying questions, acting as a virtual coach (e.g., a virtual product manager or designer) to extract necessary context from the user, leading to more robust outputs.
- **Build Self-Learning PKM Systems:** Utilize Claude Code within an IDE like Cursor to interact with local text files (e.g., Obsidian notes). Claude Code's "hooks" feature enables the system to monitor for feedback, mistakes, and new AI capabilities, autonomously suggesting and implementing improvements.
- **Leverage MCP Servers for Deterministic Workflows:** Managed Content Protocol (MCP) servers act as guardrails, ensuring that AI processes information consistently (e.g., filing tasks, integrating calendar data, or handling external tool APIs like Pendo or Salesforce) making the system less probabilistic.
- **Embrace "Vibe Coding" for Rapid Development:** Start prototyping app ideas in platforms like Gemini or Lovable, then push the code to GitHub, clone it into Cursor, and use Claude Code's multi-agent capabilities for rapid iteration and building.
- **Use AI for Red Team Analysis:** After the AI generates initial content, prompt it to "red team" its own work, critically evaluating and improving its output for higher quality and more solid results.
- **Strategic AI Tool Investment:** Focus on powerful AI-native IDEs like Cursor Pro ($20/month) which often include advanced models like Claude Opus. Integrate tools like Perplexity for research (replacing Google) and Raycast for system navigation and snippets to maximize productivity.
- **Organizational AI Transformation:** The personal AI system principles can be scaled by creating tailored GitHub repositories for different organizational functions, serving as a consistent, self-learning "brain" for teams to interact with AI, fundamentally redefining workflows and roles.
