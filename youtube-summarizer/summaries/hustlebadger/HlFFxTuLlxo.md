# How to Build a Team of Agents With Jacob Bank (CEO, Relay.app)

Video ID: `HlFFxTuLlxo`

## Summary
The video, featuring Jacob Bank (CEO of Relay.app), discusses the emerging future of knowledge work where small human teams manage large teams of AI agents. Bank explains what AI agents are, distinguishing them from chatbots and co-pilots by their proactive, integrated, and repetitive task execution. He provides a practical framework for building these agents, including designing "job descriptions" with clear "what, when, how" responsibilities, and demonstrates the process with unreleased features of Relay.app.

## Key insights
- The future of knowledge work will involve a small number of human employees managing a large team of AI agents, enabling significant leverage and capacity.
- An AI agent is defined by three characteristics: it's proactive (wakes up on its own), integrated (works directly within your tools), and repeated (performs tasks many times over time), unlike chatbots or co-pilots which are tools you use.
- To design an effective AI agent, create a "job description" with 3-4 responsibilities, each articulated clearly as "What, When, How" (e.g., "Follow up after meetings when a meeting ends by using AI to review the transcript and send a follow-up email").
- Common AI agents valuable for product managers include Executive Assistants, Competitive Analysts, Social Media Marketers, Data Analysts, User Researchers, and Project Managers.
- Security and trust in AI agents should focus on preventing errors from bad instructions (e.g., sending emails to the wrong people) rather than traditional cybersecurity threats like hacking or data locality; adding a human-in-the-loop for high-stakes actions is crucial.
- The cost efficiency of AI agents is so high relative to human labor that focusing on minor savings in AI credits is generally unproductive; prioritize getting the agent to work well for valuable tasks.
- Various agent-building platforms (Relay, Zapier, Make, N8N, Lindy, Relevance) cater to different technical skill levels and use cases, from user-friendly internal operations to complex, self-hosted deployments.
