# From Magic Pixie Dust to Strategic Decisions: Prioritising AI Requests - Randy Silver

Video ID: `zs6GakywVvk`

## Summary
Randy Silver addresses the prevalent "can't we just" problem, particularly amplified by AI hype, where stakeholders demand new features without considering strategic implications. He emphasizes the critical need for a well-defined and clearly communicated strategy—comprising a diagnosis, guiding policy, and coherent action—as the foundation for prioritization. To bridge the gap between business requests and technical feasibility, he introduces a simplified Cynefin-like framework (Clear, Complicated, Complex, Chaotic) to categorize AI initiatives and guide appropriate discussions on approach, effort, and strategic value.

## Key insights
- The "can't we just" phenomenon, especially with AI, is driven by hype and the allure of new possibilities, often overlooking underlying complexities and strategic alignment.
- A complete strategy is crucial, defined by a clear diagnosis ("where are we?"), a guiding policy ("where are we going?"), and coherent action ("how do we get there?"), moving beyond mere audacious goals.
- Strategy must be intentional and well-communicated across the organization to enable aligned decision-making at all levels and prevent misinterpretation or scattered efforts.
- Randy proposes a simplified 2x2 framework (Clear, Complicated, Complex, Chaotic) for categorizing AI initiatives, which dictates the appropriate approach (e.g., automation for Clear/Complicated, human-in-the-loop for Complex, pattern-finding for Chaotic).
- This framework transforms conversations from "magic pixie dust" into practical business terms, allowing discussions around potential ROI, cost, time, and, most importantly, strategic impact and trade-offs.
- While the definitions of the four complexity domains remain stable, the technologies and solutions that fall into each category will evolve over time as AI capabilities advance.
- Product managers need "just enough knowledge to be appropriately dangerous" in AI to ask the right questions, facilitate informed discussions, and translate between business needs and technical realities, ultimately enabling better and faster organizational decisions.
