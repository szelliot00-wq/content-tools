## Key insights
- **Purpose of CJM:** Customer Journey Maps offer a holistic understanding of the user experience across all touchpoints, driving empathy, cross-functional alignment, and identification of key problems for business impact.
- **Structure of a CJM:** Maps typically flow from left to right, detailing a series of customer journey steps, accompanied by descriptions of the customer's experience (what they see/hear/touch) and their behavior/reaction (how they feel/what they do).
- **Creation Process:** Begin by defining a persona/segment and the customer's end goal. Break the journey into 4-10 logical steps, then fill in touchpoints (visuals, user stories), customer thoughts/feelings (quotes, sentiment), and additional data (quantitative insights, provocations, ideas).
- **Collaborative Value:** Creating CJMs collaboratively with diverse teams (product, customer service, marketing) transforms it from a team-centric tool into a truly customer-centric one, fostering shared understanding and more effective problem-solving.
- **Data-Driven Insights:** While initial maps can be based on intuition, they become most powerful when driven by real customer insights, user testing, and quantitative data to accurately reflect user experiences and pain points.
- **Iterative and Dynamic:** CJMs should not be a one-time exercise; they require regular review and updates with new insights. Physical maps are encouraged for constant visibility, acting as an "extended brain" for the team.
- **Future-State Mapping:** Beyond documenting the current experience, CJMs can also be used to envision an "ideal journey" or future state, helping to storyboard a clear vision for desired product improvements and customer emotions.
