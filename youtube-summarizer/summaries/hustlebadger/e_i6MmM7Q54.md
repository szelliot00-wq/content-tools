## Summary
John Connolly, an ex-Meta product leader, delivered a webinar for Hustlebadger on coping with the inherent "messiness" of product management. He addressed common pitfalls, such as misinterpreting product best practices to alienate colleagues, and highlighted the long, often arduous journey of product transformation. Connolly also provided practical advice on evaluating if one is in the right company, stressing strategic alignment, continuous learning, and cultural fit.

## Key insights
- **Avoid being an "insufferable zealot":** Product managers should not misinterpret best practices (e.g., from Marty Cagan) to create an "us vs. them" dynamic with other departments. Instead, focus on humility, empathy, building buy-in, and understanding the company's full context and financial realities.
- **Product transformation takes years, not months:** Achieving product best practices is a long-term endeavor requiring immense patience with yourself and colleagues. Most companies are not perfect, and this "mess" is normal, providing an opportunity for impact.
- **Four anti-patterns to avoid for successful transformation:**
    1.  **Excluding Go-To-Market (GTM) teams:** Product success requires deep integration and collaboration with sales, marketing, and other GTM functions, not isolation.
    2.  **Failing fast without alternatives:** True "fail fast" means having multiple ideas in the hopper to pivot to, rather than getting stuck on a single, failing option due to a lack of alternatives.
    3.  **Selling long-term exclusively:** Balance long-term vision with short-term business realities (revenue targets, cash dynamics). Companies need to collect "gold rings" while maintaining "health."
    4.  **Not fixing delivery:** A robust and efficient engineering delivery engine is fundamental. Product managers must allow for scrutiny of delivery excellence and not defend slow execution.
- **How to tell if you're in the right company:**
    1.  **Strategic Alignment:** Ensure your personal ambitions align with the company's strategic direction (e.g., VC growth vs. PE profitability). If not, change strategy or company.
    2.  **Seek Learning:** Prioritize learning from others on the job. If isolated, actively seek out peers and mentors, even outside your company.
    3.  **Embrace the Mess:** Recognize that product challenges and organizational disarray are normal and represent an opportunity for you to create value and align people.
    4.  **Culture and Values Matter:** Respecting the company's culture, values, and how people communicate is crucial for long-term satisfaction. Prioritize this, even if it comes with a trade-off.
- **Don't take things too personally:** Separate your self-worth from project or company outcomes. Product management is about solving hard, real-world problems, including organizational ones, and the challenges you face can be your greatest opportunity.
