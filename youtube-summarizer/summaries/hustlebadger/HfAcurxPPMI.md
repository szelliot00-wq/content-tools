## Summary
This webinar, "Leading Without Authority," by Ed from HustleBadger, offers practical guidance for product managers and other professionals needing to drive initiatives without direct hierarchical power. It highlights that effective leadership and career growth come from a proactive mindset: taking ownership to deliver results, earn trust, and influence cross-functional teams and senior stakeholders. The session outlines key principles including strategic thinking, clear communication, accountability, building strong relationships, and maintaining a professional demeanor.

## Key insights
- True leadership emerges from a mental shift to own and deliver outcomes, rather than waiting for formal authority, thereby earning trust and promoting career advancement.
- Gaining credibility, especially in new roles, involves generating unique insights through data analysis, direct user research, cross-functional process mapping, or by actively embedding with other teams.
- Clear and layered communication is vital: structure recommendations with supporting reasons and evidence, tailor your message depth and language to the audience, and consistently link all tasks back to overarching company goals.
- Accountability is driven by actively reducing ambiguity, consulting stakeholders for buy-in, proactively pushing for decisions (your own or others'), and meticulously following up on all commitments.
- Building strong relationships is essential for navigating difficult conversations and fostering collaboration, requiring an investment in understanding others' perspectives, alleviating their stress, and cultivating a network of allies.
- Projecting calm confidence, particularly amidst uncertainty, and acting with integrity through clearly defined principles, makes leadership predictable, inspires trust, and empowers teams to move forward effectively.
