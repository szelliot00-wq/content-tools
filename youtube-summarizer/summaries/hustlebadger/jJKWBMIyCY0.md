## Summary
Matt LeMay's talk "How Every Product Team Can Drive Business Impact" stresses that product management is a business-accountable role, urging teams to directly connect their work to quantifiable business value. He introduces the "low impact death spiral," explaining how seemingly harmless, easy work can complicate products and hinder high-impact initiatives. LeMay advocates for high-level, "one-step-away" goals and measuring impact in the same units as company objectives, asserting that individual team bravery can overcome organizational inertia.

## Key insights
- **Product teams must be business-accountable:** Every product team should be able to justify its cost and demonstrate how its work directly moves key business numbers, answering the question, "If you were the CEO, would you fully fund this team?"
- **Avoid the "low impact death spiral":** Taking on easy, low-scrutiny work leads to product complexity, increased internal coordination, and makes high-impact work even harder, ultimately wasting resources and harming the business.
- **High-level, "one-step-away" goals drive alignment:** Instead of cascading goals, position team goals as directly connected to company-level objectives (one why statement, one mathematical operator away) to foster cross-functional collaboration and focus.
- **Prioritize with goal-aligned metrics, not abstract scores:** Measure the impact of potential work in the same units as your team's specific, ambitious goals, rather than relying on abstract scoring frameworks (like ICE/RICE) to make genuinely impactful prioritization decisions.
- **Individual bravery and persistence can override formal structure:** Meaningful change and the achievement of ambitious targets often stem from team-level conversations and the courage of individuals to question assumptions, set ambitious goals, and push for earlier market delivery, rather than waiting for top-down reorgs.
- **"Unsmart" constraints foster smart thinking:** Simple, brute-force constraints (e.g., one-page documents, limiting goals to a few) can effectively force subtractive thinking and help teams focus on what truly matters without getting bogged down in debating the constraints themselves.
- **Leaders should establish clear goals, guardrails, and short feedback loops:** This approach encourages teams to quickly test and review work, focusing on impact rather than lengthy planning or documentation.
