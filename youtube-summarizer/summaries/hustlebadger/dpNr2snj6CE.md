# Strategic Prioritisation - What RICE can't fix with Büşra Coşkuner

Video ID: `dpNr2snj6CE`

## Summary
This video, presented by Büşra Coşkuner, delves into strategic prioritization, explaining why traditional frameworks like RICE often fall short. Coşkuner asserts that effective prioritization is a "cascade of decisions" that begins with long-term strategic choices and systematically filters down to the execution-level backlog. It highlights that true prioritization is a continuous process of strategic alignment, data-driven assessment, and collaborative decision-making between leaders and individual contributors.

## Key insights
- **Prioritization is a Cascade, Not Just a Backlog Activity:** True prioritization is a continuous flow of decisions, starting from long-term (3-10 years) strategic choices, moving through mid-term and short-term strategic goals, incorporating discovery and research, and only then reaching the roadmap and backlog.
- **Three Core Activities, Four Framework Concepts:** Prioritization fundamentally involves categorization (bucketing items), filtering (reducing items based on criteria), and sorting (ordering items, typically by ROI). All prioritization frameworks ultimately rely on four concepts: scoring, matrices, ruling out, and calculation.
- **Strategy is the Foundation:** Painful prioritization occurs when strategic focus is absent, goals are unclear, decisions change frequently, or strategic choices are poorly communicated. Leaders must define clear strategic choices from the outset to narrow down options and enable effective prioritization.
- **Beyond Scoring: Impact and Confidence Matter:** While frameworks provide structure, the discussion should center on assessing impact and confidence through evidence, rather than just the final score. Prioritization is more about understanding what will truly create value and how certain you are of that impact.
- **Backlog Prioritization is an Art:** At the final backlog level, prioritization becomes an "art" that integrates strategic filtering with practical considerations like politics, stakeholder needs, tech debt, discovery vs. delivery balance, deadlines (e.g., GDPR), and intuition.
- **A Joint Effort:** Effective prioritization is a shared responsibility. Leaders are "prioritization enablers" by making difficult strategic choices and narrowing options. Individual contributors support this by providing options, input, and suggestions, ensuring leadership has the necessary insights for decision-making.
