## Summary
Fabrice des Mazery argues that product management has often failed to fulfill its promise of turning technology into a profit center, instead becoming a cost center focused on frameworks. He advocates for product teams to adopt an investor mindset, prioritizing "double impact"—generating ROI for both users and the company. He outlines three core principles—co-investment, capping, and portfolio management—to guide product decisions, ensuring financial accountability and shared responsibility across the organization.

## Key insights
- Product management has often strayed from its core promise of transforming technology into a profit center, instead becoming a cost center focused on elaborate frameworks and user-centricity without sufficient financial accountability.
- The "Double Impact" principle states that product initiatives must simultaneously generate ROI for both the user (value, experience) and the company (financial returns) to be truly successful and justifiable.
- **Co-investment:** Product teams should view their time and resources as a significant financial investment (e.g., $1M/year per team). Stakeholders must also become co-investors by committing their own resources (network, time, sales effort) and sharing accountability for the outcomes, moving beyond simply requesting features.
- **Capping:** All product activities, including discovery, delivery, and go-to-market efforts, should have capped investments. This treats time as a finite budget, forcing prioritization and ensuring that initiatives stay within defined financial appetites to maintain target ROI.
- **Portfolio Management:** A product strategy is an investment thesis. Product teams should allocate their investment budget into a balanced portfolio of initiatives (e.g., low-hanging fruit, strategic initiatives, high-risk bets, tech debt), consciously deciding what *not* to do and comparing opportunities within specific strategic envelopes.
- **Launch vs. Landing:** Product success isn't just about launching features; it's about tracking where they "land" (their actual post-release impact and ROI) over time. This continuous evaluation informs future investment decisions and reinforces accountability.
- **GenAI Considerations:** While the principles apply, GenAI introduces unique challenges related to trust (probabilistic products), pricing models (e.g., usage-based vs. per-seat), defining success metrics, and technical feasibility, requiring a new approach to risk assessment and value generation.
