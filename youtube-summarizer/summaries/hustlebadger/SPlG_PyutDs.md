# Jason Knight explains How to Nail Your Relationship with Sales

Video ID: `SPlG_PyutDs`

## Summary
This video addresses the often-dysfunctional relationship between product and sales teams, particularly in B2B companies. Jason Knight highlights how differing motivations—sales focused on immediate revenue and product on future strategy—lead to problems like "feature factories" and "revenue debt." He argues that while sales teams are doing their job based on incentives, product teams also bear responsibility for a lack of engagement and clear strategy.

## Key insights
- **Dysfunctional Relationship Roots:** Product and sales teams often operate in different worlds with misaligned motivations; sales focuses on current quarter's revenue, while product ideally focuses on next year's, leading to conflict over feature requests.
- **Sales Incentives Drive Behavior:** Sales teams are incentivized by quarterly revenue goals, making them prioritize immediate deals and feature requests. Product teams given similar incentives would likely make similar "short-term" decisions.
- **The Pitfall of "Product-Led":** The concept of "product-led" is often misunderstood as product teams dictating decisions, which is alienating. True success comes from collaboration and recognizing that a great product benefits everyone.
- **Revenue Debt:** Chasing short-term revenue from "wrong customers" (poor fit) leads to strategic liabilities, a disconnected and incoherent product, and an inability to say no to future requests, making it harder to evolve.
- **Handling "Sales Specials" (Feature Requests):** Product teams should evaluate requests using a quadrant (effort vs. strategic alignment), aiming to simplify, descoping, or productizing later, rather than blindly building. Saying "no" or "yes" requires a strong defense based on product vision, strategy, and business impact.
- **Product's Proactive Role:** Product teams must actively build relationships with sales, get visibility into the sales funnel, engage directly with prospects to understand true needs, establish clear vision and strategy, track the impact of specials, and get involved in sales enablement and win/loss analysis.
- **Systemic Change:** Addressing deeply ingrained sales-driven cultures requires framing the benefits of strategic product management in terms of financial outcomes and problems that leadership already cares about (e.g., retention, sales cycle length), rather than just "being product-led."
