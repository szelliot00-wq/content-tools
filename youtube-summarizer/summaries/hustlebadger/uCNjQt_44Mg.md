# Opportunity Solution Trees - Beyond the basics

Video ID: `uCNjQt_44Mg`

## Summary
The video, presented by Ed Biden of HustleBerger, details the creation and application of Opportunity Solution Trees (OSTs) as a visual framework for mapping product strategy and discovery. It breaks down OSTs into four core layers: a clearly defined Outcome (mission and metrics), identified Opportunities (customer or business problems), proposed Solutions (hypothesized builds), and critical Assumptions (risks to be tested). The speaker emphasizes that building OSTs is an iterative process designed to foster alignment, facilitate communication, and enable informed decision-making within product teams.

## Key insights
-   **OST Structure:** Opportunity Solution Trees visually map product strategy and discovery, comprising four layers: Outcome, Opportunities, Solutions, and Assumptions.
-   **Outcome Definition:** Goals should combine a qualitative mission with measurable metrics, ideally formatted as "move [metric] from [baseline] to [target] by [date]" to ensure clarity and trackability.
-   **Opportunity Discovery & Prioritization:** Opportunities (customer or business problems) are identified through user interviews, behavioral analysis, process mapping, and subject matter expert discussions, then prioritized based on impact modeling, customer severity/incidence, company strategy, and market factors.
-   **Solution Generation:** Solutions are best developed as hypotheses by combining a clear problem diagnosis with diverse inspiration from a multi-disciplinary team, ensuring they logically connect back to the opportunity and overall outcome.
-   **Assumption Mapping:** Assumptions identify inherent risks (value, business, technical, usability) associated with solutions, guiding discovery efforts by prompting questions about existing evidence and defining next steps to test or mitigate those risks.
-   **Iterative & Adaptive Use:** The process of building an OST is iterative, not linear, and its value lies in facilitating conversations and decisions; the level of detail and time invested should be flexible, reflecting whether it's a one-off check or a living document.
-   **Avoiding Logical Flaws:** OSTs help product teams visually identify when a proposed solution doesn't clearly address an opportunity or contribute to the defined outcome, preventing the development of features that lack strategic impact.
-   **Stakeholder Communication:** When facing pushback from non-product stakeholders, translate discussions into their terms, seek to understand their perspective, and quantify the financial and opportunity costs of building without sufficient evidence.
