# Head of Claude Code: What happens after coding is solved | Boris Cherny

Video ID: `We7BZVKbCVw`

## Summary
The video features Boris Cherny, Head of Claude Code at Anthropic, discussing the profound impact of AI on software development. He highlights how Claude Code has dramatically increased engineer productivity, with 100% of his code now AI-generated, effectively "solving" traditional coding. Cherny believes AI will transform roles by enabling anyone to "program" and creating "builders" who focus on problem-solving, with AI handling the technical minutiae, driving both immense opportunities and significant disruption.

## Key insights
- **Coding is "Largely Solved":** Boris Cherny personally experiences 100% AI-generated code, shipping 10-30 pull requests daily without manual edits. He states that learning to code conventionally will be less critical in a year or two as AI will handle most programming.
- **Explosive Productivity Gains:** Anthropic has seen a 200% increase in productivity per engineer since adopting Claude Code, with AI now authoring 4% of all GitHub commits (and accelerating).
- **AI as a "Co-worker" and Ideator:** Claude is evolving beyond code generation to suggest ideas, analyze feedback, bug reports, and telemetry for features and fixes, acting more like an active collaborator.
- **Shift to "Builders" and Generalists:** The title "software engineer" may be replaced by "builder," where individuals across functions (PMs, designers, data scientists, even finance) will "code" using AI. Success will increasingly favor curious generalists who can think across disciplines and focus on broader problem-solving.
- **Latent Demand in Product Development:** Building effective AI products involves observing how users (and the model itself) "abuse" existing tools for unintended purposes, revealing strong latent demand (e.g., how Claude Code's non-coding uses led to Co-Work).
- **Anthropic's Safety-First Approach:** AI safety is paramount, studied through three layers: alignment (mechanistic interpretability of model neurons), evals (laboratory testing), and real-world behavior (releasing early as research previews).
- **Principles for Building with AI:**
    - **Don't "box" the model:** Provide tools and a goal, allowing the AI to figure out the solution rather than imposing strict workflows.
    - **Bet on the more general model:** The "bitter lesson" suggests general models will always outperform specific ones; don't over-optimize with scaffolding or fine-tuning too early.
    - **Build for the future model:** Design products for the capabilities of models six months out, accepting initial rough edges for a strong fit when the more advanced models arrive.
    - **Empower with tokens:** Allow engineers liberal access to tokens for experimentation, as the innovation potential outweighs initial costs.
- **Co-Work for Broader Automation:** The Co-Work product, built in 10 days, extends Claude's agentic capabilities to automate general computer tasks (e.g., paying bills, project management, email responses) via web and desktop interfaces.
- **Personal Enjoyment and Disruption:** While many (70% of engineers and PMs surveyed) enjoy their jobs more due to AI automating tedious tasks, the transition will be highly disruptive and potentially "painful" for many, akin to the impact of the printing press.
- **Practical Usage Tips for Claude Code:** Use the most capable model (e.g., Opus 4.6), start tasks in "plan mode" (shift-tab twice in terminal) for better strategy, and explore various interfaces beyond the terminal (desktop app, mobile, Slack).
