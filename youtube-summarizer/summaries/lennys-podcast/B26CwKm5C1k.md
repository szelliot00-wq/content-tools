## Summary
Sherwin Wu, Head of Platform Engineering at OpenAI, shares insights on the transformative impact of AI on software engineering, management, and the broader economy over the next 12-24 months. He details how AI tools like Codex are redefining engineers' roles into "wizards" managing agents and predicts a "golden age of B2B SaaS" spurred by the rise of one-person billion-dollar startups. Wu also discusses the critical need for bottoms-up adoption in successful AI deployments, OpenAI's commitment to an open platform, and future model advancements in longer-task coherence and multimodal audio capabilities.

## Key insights
-   **AI's Impact on Engineering:** 95% of OpenAI engineers use Codex daily, and 100% of PRs are reviewed by Codex, leading to engineers opening 70% more PRs. The role is shifting from writing code to "managing fleets of agents," akin to wizards casting spells.
-   **Managing AI-Driven Teams:** While AI makes top performers "exceptional," managers should focus on unblocking these individuals. Managers may soon oversee larger teams, leveraging AI to understand organizational context and anticipate blockers.
-   **The "One-Person Billion-Dollar Startup" Effect:** This trend will lead to a boom in smaller startups (e.g., $10-$100 million businesses), creating a "golden age of B2B SaaS" as bespoke software is built to support these high-leverage individuals.
-   **Successful AI Adoption:** Many AI deployments fail due to a lack of "bottoms-up adoption." Companies need to cultivate internal "tiger teams" of enthusiastic, technical-adjacent employees (not necessarily software engineers) to explore AI capabilities and evangelize best practices.
-   **"Models Will Eat Your Scaffolding for Breakfast":** Due to rapid model evolution, builders should focus on creating products for where models are *going*, not where they are today, as current tooling and frameworks can quickly become obsolete.
-   **Future of AI Models:** Expect models to perform multi-hour coherent tasks within 12-18 months, enabling entirely new product types. Multimodal models, especially in audio, are an "underrated domain" poised for significant advancements.
-   **Underrated Opportunity: Business Process Automation:** The greatest untapped potential for AI lies in automating repeatable business processes outside of traditional tech, impacting vast segments of the global economy.
-   **OpenAI as a Platform:** OpenAI's mission is to spread AI benefits broadly, viewing itself as an ecosystem platform that empowers others. Startups should focus on building products customers love rather than worrying about OpenAI "squashing" their ideas, given the immense market opportunity.
-   **Seize the Moment:** The next 2-3 years will be incredibly exciting for tech; individuals are encouraged to engage with AI tools, learn, and lean in to avoid missing out on this transformative period.
