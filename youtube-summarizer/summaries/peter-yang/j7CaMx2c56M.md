# Full Tutorial: The Most Underrated AI Agent for Coding and Product Work | Eno Reyes (Factory)

Video ID: `j7CaMx2c56M`

## Summary
This video features Eno Reyes, co-founder of Factory, discussing their AI coding agent, Droid, and demonstrating its capabilities. Droid is presented as an enterprise-focused solution for software development, emphasizing rigorous self-validation, customizable "skills," and integration with existing codebases. The discussion covers Droid's practical application in building web apps and managing product tasks, alongside insights into the evolving roles of engineers and product managers in the AI era.

## Key insights
-   Droid by Factory is an AI coding agent designed primarily for enterprise environments, offering features like code analysis, ROI analytics, and hierarchical controls to ensure comfort and utility for large organizations.
-   A key differentiator is Droid's rigorous self-validation process, where it autonomously tests its work, takes screenshots, and checks for errors, leading to higher quality output and reducing manual testing efforts.
-   The platform offers "spec mode," enabling users to define the *what* (specification) of a product, while Droid autonomously determines the *how* (plan), and allows dynamic switching of AI models and autonomy levels mid-session for optimal performance and cost.
-   "Skills" are presented as crucial for customizing workflows, integrating with tools like Notion and Linear, and ensuring consistency with company-specific principles or design systems, with enterprise-level management for shared access.
-   AI agents are transforming roles beyond software engineering; Factory's hiring of "product engineers" and the extensive use of Droid by sales AEs highlight that these agents democratize access to technical capabilities, making them general computer-use agents rather than just coding tools.
-   Factory's competitive strategy focuses on solving "harder software problems" for enterprise customers, such as refactoring legacy codebases, which naturally leads to superior agent performance and broader applicability, distinguishing them in the crowded AI coding space.
-   The future vision for AI agents is as a ubiquitous "overlay" on the computer, capable of interacting with the entire system (file system, apps, desktop) to perform nearly any task, rather than being confined to an IDE or terminal.
