# Frameworks that Actually Work

Video ID: `VS0ugYzeL8Y`

## Summary
This video addresses the common challenge of scaling successful product management practices and intuition across an organization. The speaker argues that many frameworks fail because they are designed to look impressive rather than to be practical and implementable. He defines a "good framework" as one that packages the decomposed intuition of a world-class practitioner, making it effective for substantially raising others' capabilities. The video is highly relevant for product leaders and managers tasked with fostering strategic competence and standardizing high-quality work across their teams by providing a methodology for creating truly useful frameworks.

## Key insights
*   **Misconception of Frameworks:** Process or frameworks are not inherently bad; the problem lies in misunderstanding what constitutes a good one. The industry often suffers from binary thinking about frameworks, ignoring many nuanced approaches.
*   **Industry Pressure & Flawed Approach:** The expectation in some company interviews for PMs to present a framework, or the desire to create impressive-looking frameworks for approval, often leads to ineffective outputs that "don't work."
*   **Definition of a Good Framework:** A good framework "packages the intuition of someone who is world class at that given thing." It aims to capture the deep understanding and thought processes of top performers.
*   **Faulty Framework Creation Example:** The speaker criticizes superficial frameworks described as "an octagonal framework with eight colors with opposing vertices and call them some name and then create a backronym" designed for social media likes rather than practical application.
*   **Effective Approach to Framework Creation (Reverse Engineering Intuition):** To create a good framework, one must identify a world-class practitioner (e.g., someone excellent at giving feedback in UX reviews or producing compelling product strategies). Then, "look within" and "reverse engineer" their intuition by evaluating *how*, *what*, and *why* they think and act the way they do.
*   **Difficulty of Reverse Engineering Intuition:** This process, while seemingly simple, is "incredibly hard to do" and requires significant effort and time. However, it is crucial for developing truly effective frameworks.
*   **Benefits of Effective Frameworks:** Frameworks built this way are practical and implementable. They "substantially raise their capability very quickly," even if they don't immediately make everyone world-class, which is the desired outcome for scaling.
*   **Real-world Motivation:** The speaker's deep thinking on this topic was prompted by guidance at Stripe, where leadership wanted to scale the "compelling product strategies" produced by his team to more PMs.

## Use cases
*   **Scaling Best Practices:** When leadership identifies a high-performing team or individual and wants to replicate their success or specific skills across the organization.
*   **Improving Strategic Competence:** For product leaders aiming to elevate the quality of product strategies or other critical outputs from their product management teams, as exemplified by the Stripe scenario.
*   **Developing Specific Skills:** To effectively train and improve team members' abilities in specialized areas where certain individuals demonstrate world-class expertise (e.g., providing effective UX feedback).
*   **Onboarding and Training Programs:** Designing more impactful onboarding experiences or ongoing training modules that distill expert knowledge into actionable guidance.
*   **Knowledge Transfer Initiatives:** Systematically capturing and disseminating tacit knowledge from experienced "world-class" practitioners to less experienced colleagues.
*   **Addressing Performance Gaps:** Creating targeted interventions to improve team or individual performance by leveraging the methods of top performers.

## Patterns & frameworks
*   **Good Framework (Speaker's Definition):** This is a mental model for what constitutes an effective framework. It is defined as "packaged intuition" of a world-class expert. It functions by deconstructing the expert's thought processes (how, what, why they think) into practical, implementable components, serving as a guide for others to improve their capabilities.
*   **Reverse Engineering Intuition:** This is the underlying process or repeatable pattern for developing a "good framework." It involves deep introspection and analytical decomposition of an expert's actions and mental models to uncover the core principles and thinking that drive their superior performance, which can then be codified.
