# Treating Everything Like a Product and Understanding Your Users: How Shreyas Teaches, Why He Teaches

Video ID: `mbs0uo0h8Dw`

## Summary
This video transcript details Shreyas Doshi's journey and philosophy behind creating and teaching online courses, particularly on Maven. It emphasizes treating a course as a product, requiring a deep understanding of the user (student) to design a truly transformative learning experience. Shreyas argues that genuine course quality and "aha moments" are the primary drivers of word-of-mouth marketing, far outweighing reliance on marketing tactics or large social media followings. The insights are highly relevant for aspiring and current online instructors, product managers, and entrepreneurs focused on building high-value educational offerings.

## Key insights
-   **Initial Hesitation & Motivation:** Shreyas was initially reluctant to teach, taking almost a year to decide, despite Gagan's persistence. His primary motivation stemmed from a desire to scale his advising work with founders and PMs, as he was frequently turning down requests. He also had a lifelong passion for teaching, dating back to his teenage years.
-   **"Course as a Product" Mindset:** Shreyas views course creation as product development, necessitating a deep understanding of the "user" (student)—their fears, concerns, hesitations, and the questions they'll have at each point in the course. Every design and teaching choice must be intentional and rooted in this user understanding.
-   **Stressful First Launch:** Shreyas decided to teach his first course, "Managing Your PM Career," in early September 2022 for an October launch. This gave him only 6-8 weeks to create all materials from scratch for over 100 signed-up students, leading to immense stress.
-   **Extreme Preparedness:** Driven by anxiety over delivery, Shreyas implemented extreme backup plans. For his first course, he arranged a backup house with Gagan in case of internet outage. Currently, he has three internet access options at home, a nearby co-working space with a team-prepared "playlist" for his commute, and several backup homes.
-   **Internally Driven Topic Selection:** Shreyas does not conduct market analysis for course topics. Instead, he introspects to find unique ideas and insights he is inherently driven to share, particularly those that have made people's "eyes light up" during advising or coaching conversations.
-   **Strategic Course Sequencing:** While his ultimate passion was the "Product Sense" course, he realized it would take two more years to develop to his desired quality. To gain experience and practice teaching, he first launched "Managing Your PM Career," which was less extensive and quicker to create, even delivering it over an intense single weekend. This "easier path" allowed him to learn the logistics and build confidence.
-   **Word-of-Mouth is Key:** Shreyas "obsesses" over word-of-mouth (WOM) as a core metric, tracking that approximately 35% of his students first hear about his courses from friends, family, or colleagues. Gagan corroborates this, stating WOM is the #1 sales driver for successful courses on Maven (higher than LinkedIn).
-   **Social Media Following Limits:** While a large social media following can provide an initial boost, Shreyas learned that it reaches an "asymptote." Only a small percentage (e.g., 200-400 people from 100k followers) will ever sign up for a paid course, necessitating other strategies beyond simply broadcasting to one's network. The majority of Maven's "million-dollar instructors" started with less than 10,000 followers.
-   **Meticulous Course Positioning:** Shreyas invests heavily in positioning his courses, especially the landing page. For his Product Sense course, he has 50 FAQs, many written upfront to preemptively address potential student objections and hesitations. He tailors the page for "serious students" who are willing to read deeply and understand exactly what they'll get.
-   **Skill-Oriented Teaching:** For his Product Sense course, Shreyas intentionally chose a "skill-oriented" approach over typical "process-oriented," "story-oriented," or "framework-oriented" methods. This influences everything from daily structure to prompts and landing page messaging, aiming for students to build the actual skill during the course.
-   **Quality Over Tactics:** Shreyas firmly believes that 98-99% of word-of-mouth comes from the core quality of the product (course) itself, not from marketing "hacks" or "tricks." He encourages instructors to focus on creating the most transformative experience possible, analogous to how people enthusiastically recommend products/services they genuinely love.
-   **Team & Support:** Shreyas credits his amazing team (Kate and Nicole) for handling course operations, and also acknowledges the Maven team for early advice and support in structuring his first cohorts.

## Use cases
-   **Aspiring Online Instructors:** For individuals considering creating and launching their first online course, especially those looking to teach specialized skills or topics.
-   **Existing Online Instructors:** To re-evaluate their course design, marketing strategies, and student experience with a product-centric approach.
-   **Product Managers:** To apply the "product thinking" framework to non-traditional products, such as educational courses, and understand the importance of user empathy.
-   **Entrepreneurs & Founders:** For anyone launching a new service, product, or educational offering, emphasizing deep user understanding and intrinsic value over superficial marketing.
-   **Coaches & Advisors:** To scale their impact and reach a wider audience beyond one-on-one engagements, by packaging their expertise into a structured course.
-   **Curriculum Designers:** To incorporate principles of user psychology, intentional design, and skill development into their educational programs.
-   **Content Creators:** To shift focus from simply generating content to creating truly transformative and shareable experiences.

## Patterns & frameworks
-   **Treating Everything Like a Product:** This is Shreyas's overarching mental model, applying product management principles (user understanding, intentional design, iterative improvement) to online course creation. The course itself is seen as a product to be developed and refined.
-   **Deep User Understanding:** A core component of the "product mindset." This involves meticulously understanding the target student's fears, concerns, hesitations, existing knowledge, and questions that will arise during the learning process. This understanding drives all course design and communication decisions.
-   **Qualitative Demand Assessment ("Eyes Light Up"):** Instead of quantitative market analysis, Shreyas gauges demand qualitatively. He looks for "eyes light up" moments when sharing insights with individuals in advising or coaching, indicating that the information is uniquely valuable and resonates deeply.
-   **Internally Driven Topic Selection:** A counter-approach to traditional market research. Shreyas prioritizes teaching topics he is inherently passionate about, where he possesses unique insights, and which he loves to share, believing this authenticity leads to better course quality.
-   **Course Positioning Axes:** Shreyas uses a framework to intentionally position his courses. For example, he explicitly chose his Product Sense course to be **skill-oriented** (focused on building a practical skill) rather than **process-oriented**, **story-oriented**, or **framework-oriented**. This clarity then informs all aspects of course design and marketing.
