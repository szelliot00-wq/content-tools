If you can't build a production app without AI, it's going to be really hard to build a production app. >> Is there a point where AI starts to replace developers or replace product managers? >> I think what PMs really need to do is level up the skill of understanding what they're building. >> Nadav Abrami is one of the co-founders of Wix, the $5.5 billion online website building giant whose stock has 5xed since its IPO in 2013. What happened for PM is that they were just gotten a huge get out of no developers JCard. Now with AI, it's not a huge investment. It's the cheapest option time-wise. >> Why should they be using an AI prototyping tool or when should they be using an AI prototyping tool? >> You get an experience that is something that's more functional that you can play around with that you can put users in front of and they can actually get the real experience. How should PMs be preparing themselves for [music] whatever is happening in the next 3 to 5 years with AI?

Everyone thinks AI will replace developers, but you have a different perspective. What's your take? >> I think AI is a it's a tool and it's a tool that lets you do a lot of things, but you can create in it only so much more than you can understand or that you do understand. So it depends on uh who's exactly are you and and what exactly is your skill set but it's not a anybody can build anything tool. It is an amazing tool for some things. It's an amazing tool for PMs that build prototypes all the time. Uh it's an amazing tool if I want to just build a small app that I can use for something that's not my main business or just an enabling tool as part of my business. So it there's so many use cases, but I think the most amazing ones are for product managers. >> So you can't really build a production app with AI today. You would say >> it really depends on who you are. If you can build a production app without AI, then definitely you can build a production app with AI. If you can't build a production app without AI, it's going to be really hard to use AI correctly to build a production app. And and it's a gap of knowledge. a lot of it. It It's not a gap that's going to stay there. >> That makes sense. So, you need to be able to understand the code behind it. And we will live demo that for you guys in a second. So, when should people be using AI prototyping tools >> all the time? They're amazing. They're magical. I've heard of so many use cases that you would not imagine. It's from closet companies like small family businesses building an editor to design their closets just so they don't do it in paper anymore and printing that to my kids building a small platformer where they need to escape the the farts of ship. It's really really is endless and and those are just like the the cases where you say I want something small and I can do it myself and I couldn't before and nobody would build it before. But I think again the people that are going to use it daily that it's going to become their main tool of work RPMs because they keep getting to the point where they want to create something and experiment with it more than anybody else. And also they really know how to talk to developers and explain what they want and basically what they got now is in the virtual developer. So when a PM is using it, why should they be using an AI prototyping tool or when should they be using an AI prototyping tool versus Figma or Cursor's new visual editor? >> You get something else from Figma and from Vibe coding tools. You get an experience that is something that's more functional that you can play around with that you can put users in front of and they can actually get the real experience and and it's not like functional prototypes or something totally new. We built them, we used to build them a lot in weeks for big features, for stuff that we really want to test out with users. We used to build them but it was just a huge investment. Now with AI it's not a huge investment. the cheapest option time-wise. It's the fastest way to get to something I can play with, that's something I can even look at. So, it it really changed it. If it's something that used to be very rare for really complex features, now there's no feature that goes through the ideation stage without at least a few functional prototypes. So, every feature goes through this step, but it's it's really a matter of of where to use it in the process because you want it to come at theation step. You want to try out a number of new ideas. Sometimes you really don't want to give a spec. You just want to give an idea and see what the AI does and maybe run that a few times and see what the AI does differently because first of all it'll open your mind. It's super interesting and it really lets you not just imagine it on a piece of paper and imagine how it is to play with it. Lets you play with all of these variations. And the second place is really after choosing sometimes after Figma you want to get it to feel production ready. It doesn't need to be production ready but you really want to get the prototype if you really want validation for the feature and you really want to play with it with users. There's another step there where you take the idea you chose and the design you chose and you want to get it in front of users as fast as you can and it's always faster to do a prototype than to get it to production. One criticism I've heard of these tools and this has come from people even as famous as Ittimar Galad who is one of the most well-known PM influencers. He said that if when we jump into prototyping for ideiation for instance we sometimes are going too fast into the solution space. We're not spending enough time on the problem space. How do PMS think about the life cycle of product development and what they should be doing in the problem space and when they should move to the solution space and start looking at a prototype? >> That's a really interesting question. First of all, vibe coding tools and and basically also Figma, every prototyping tool, every tool where you give the output of what's there, what what you want there means that you want what know what's there. And I totally agree. I think research is super important in PM's job. Both research on the web and using AI tools for research just to research how this feature looks like, what user stories you have. There's a lot to do before you even get to prototyping. And I would never give up that step. I think it's it's all about research and communicating with users. The visual aspect of the feature you're building is usually not the big thing. It is a big part of the job obviously, but it's by the time you got to it, you already know what the feature is that you want exactly and that's really the big decision. >> So really, you need to understand what problem you're solving, what user story, and the rough shape of the feature, right? So these three elements, if you guys truly want to master AI prototyping, you can't just jump in to the solution space. That's why we wanted to start here, you guys, to give you the context of what we're about to show you. This is when to use it. Don't overuse a tool. Whenever a new tool comes out, we just want to use a hammer on everything. AI prototyping has its place, and now we're going to show you exactly what its place is. So let's get into it. Can you show us how to build something from scratch in Dazzle? >> Okay. So I'll start by opening Dazzle and and let's try to go through a flow really the flow that RPMs go through. The flow that I really believe for uh PMS in using such products. So as you said we could choose what we wanted and we were uh talking to you on LinkedIn. So we chose to add a feature to LinkedIn and we're going to simulate like we're a product manager working in LinkedIn. We have a great idea for a new feature. But even before we start, the first thing we really want is we want to build on something. We want to start by having something that looks like our product that we can start from. So let's start from there. Uh I'm going to already uh took a screenshot of Lindon. So I'm just going to drop it here and tell it a small prompt to recreate the page. And we're sending it to go. So, it's going to take it uh minute or so and it's important to understand what it does in the meantime. Dazzle uh ramps up really a server for you. I I know I'm diving into technicals here, but I think it's important to understand I always think it's important to understand uh as a PM some of some of the technical decisions behind your product. In this case, it means that it's very much open. you actually have a server. It can talk to wherever you want. Bring data from wherever you want and pretty much to anything you can imagine on the web. It does take a bit more time and it just finished raising the server and it's starting to write the code. Now, the reason I said that it's uh I I always start with this. I start with copying the product I want to add a feature to at the very least the visual aspects of it. So I'm not starting from a blank page and I can basically see where I want to fit the new feature inside. Also, it's super important because I I can save that. I can reuse that. I can then build a lot of features from that, which is really it's going to save me a lot of time in the flow later. >> Today's podcast is brought to you by Pendo, the leading software experience management platform. McKenzie found that 78% of companies are using Genai, but just as many have reported no bottom line improvements. So, how do you know if your AI agents are actually working? Are they giving users the wrong answers? Creating more work instead of less, improving retention, or hurting it. When your software data and AI data are disconnected, you can't answer these questions. But when you bring all your usage data together in one place, you can see what users do before, during, and after they use AI. showing you when agents work, how they help you grow, and when to prioritize on your roadmap. Pendo Agent Analytics is the only solution built to do this for product teams. Start measuring your AI's performance with agent analytics at pendo.io/ aos. That's pendo.io/ a kh. AI is writing code faster than ever, but can your testing keep up? Test Cube is the Kubernetes native platform that scales testing at the pace of AI accelerated development.

That's te s kub.io/ a kh. So it sounds like as a product leader, if you're introducing Dazzle or an air prototyping tool to your team, you might want to do this first step for people where it brings in the design system, it starts to look like their existing product so that they can just pick it up and start using it from that. >> Totally. You want to do that and you want to save it with a template. That feature is coming really soon to Dazzle and you want to save it as a template and reuse it across your organization. You want to then start building all the features from this and you want to probably keep maintaining that project as your project involves. Keep it tight and very close visually, not just visually, even almost functionally to your product. So you can open the same screen so you can see the same experiences and then everybody can just copy that and mutate from that. >> It seems like if you want visual fidelity, it might even make sense to bring in a designer just to get those details right for the template that everyone's using. >> For sure. And and this is one of the places where really dazzle shines because you can really tweak it visually and get it to where you want. Okay. I think it's about almost done. It's probably going to take it a few more seconds. >> One of the things you mentioned and you've emphasized whenever we work together is it's important to understand what's going on in the back end. So maybe can you just read through and explain some of those green check marks what exactly it's done so far? >> Sure. So what's happening behind the the basically be under the hood is that uh Dazzle is starting to write code for your project. Now the first thing that's done here it's wrote the theme CSS. It's basically the design system of this project. We're going to take a deep dive into it later and maybe tweak it a bit. And then it basically started writing the data and the styles and the components for this homepage that we requested. uh when it finishes to do that, it's going to go through a validating step. Basically, there's a lot of tools developers use to to validate their code. If it's a type checking and build errors and a lot of things that you can see just to check that the code is working well and just finish writing the code and now it's going to basically validate it. So, as I said, it's going to type check. It's going to check that there are no broken images. It's going to check that there are no errors and that basically you can continue from this point. >> And you said CSS. Those are cascading stylesheets. This is used in basically every single website out there. Is Dazzle going to be building on top of Tailwind? >> Well, we're thinking of adding Tailwind support, but I have to say my feeling about the matter is that Tailwind is great if you want to create stuff that looks like it was built exactly in that design system. You can tweak it a bit, but if you really want to get out of the box, you see people even like influencers that are really pushing Tailwind, you see them using Tailwind and something. And it's because it's really nice for for getting the fast simple design, but you're you're getting the same design system. It it really it's a technical thing in a way and that maybe technical for designers more than technical for developers but there's a lot to be said to having your own design system and tweaking your own design system and not just building on that. So first of all you can see that Dazzle uh built a page. It looks pretty much like screenshot I took. I do feel that some of the colors are a bit off. So let's start uh visually editing before we do something else. >> Yeah, that was what stood out to me as well, the colors. >> Yeah, right. This one is totally off. So, you know what? What I'm going to do is I I want the reference. So, I'm just going to click add here. And I'm going to add the image here. And basically, let's put the LinkedIn image here just so it's easy to compare. One second. I'm going to drag it here into the upload. And let's select it. And now I can see the image here. And you can see that the colors are really off. So, let's go back here. And I want a custom color. And I want this one. Much better. And >> nice. So, you can just use an eyropper tool to match your colors. >> Oh, yeah. Yeah, for sure. Uh, you can drag images inside. There's a lot of visual editing that you're going to see here. And I'm going to mention some of it what I'm doing, but a lot of the things you're going to see here is not something you're going to see somewhere else. So, that's it. And now I'm going to click backspace and delete this image because it was just there for reference. >> Okay. >> Easier to move. It didn't mess up anything. >> Oh, no. You can really uh let's say I want this button to the right. Most of the fins I can really do pretty simply in a way that you're not going to see in any other visual editor of code or any other vibe coding tool. This is what we do. This is uh like I I co-ounded Wix. I love visual editors. So uh that's one tweak. Uh another thing is let's obviously this is not the dazzle image. Let's choose product media and choose this thing. Much better. And now what do you think? Anything else you want to tweak before we uh continue to add a new feature? >> Maybe we also update the dazzle image on the page posts down a little bit further. Yeah, >> this one. >> Yeah. >> Oh, for sure. >> Excellent. I would say it's like a nine and a half out of 10. It's basically there. >> It can always be better. And I think it's it's really as as you said, Aash, it's it's putting a bit more prompts into it or putting a bit more visual tweaks into it. If you're working with the designer, maybe get him to contribute some to the project and and get it to look right to him. Because I'm not a designer. I'm sure all the designers looking at this right now are saying, "No, it doesn't look good enough." And and I don't even see it. And which is okay. I'm more a PM and technical person than a designer. And and it's not my job to see it. Uh just to be held at and then fix it. Uh so let's let's do build a feature. So uh what I was thinking about is let's add uh sentiment analysis. basically something that just says about the comments of uh each feature of each post sorry whether it's the sentiments are positive negative and so on. So I made a pre-bade the prompt here and let's just send it in. It's not a big prompt as you can see and it's not a big feature and it's a lot of times it's not about the big features it's it's being unlocked. I feel like what happened for PMs is that they were just gotten a huge uh get out of no developers J card. Uh where before that they were blocked whenever they wanted to do something small and now it's just magic. >> Yeah, I'm actually coaching somebody who she got hired before they hired the engineering team. So they hired the PM first. Just happened that way. And for the first couple weeks it was like what is she going to do? Then the first thing we did is we said okay let's get access to an AI prototyping tool so that we can at least come up with some good specs validate those specs before the engineers come on board so that when they come on board they can hit the ground running and so it happened like they hired some Google engineer on day one he was one of those guys who's just hitting the ground running and because she had four or five AI prototypes he found okay this one is really easy one and he got to work and in the first week he was able to ship something. So this can really accelerate your ability to work with a small or no engineering team >> and the fact that you can actually it's you have a server you have an entire application. It is something you could start a production up from if you're technical enough or want to invest enough you could get to a production app. I do feel like the main use case though is is playing around in prototyping for that. This technology is super exciting and super amazing. So okay I can see we have let's go to preview something to play around with it. So we have a sentiment here and I see there's some rollover of it. What do you say a cash? What do you want to change about it? >> Well I think the most powerful thing about these air prototyping tools is that you can actually create very quickly divergent solutions. So we have one implementation here. Maybe what we can do is there a way for us to maybe branch this or try out a second implementation that that looks visually different? >> Well, what we can do is ask the AI to add a toggle at the top and have these two behaviors. So, what do you want the second behavior or the sentiment to be? >> Maybe right now we have like sentiment. It's attached to the page posts. What if we had sentiment as its separate bucket on the page below the page posts that was like sentiment analysis of your page posts and maybe it just showed a quick summary of your last few and then you could click in to get more details. >> Okay, so let's add it as a different section and then decide if to hide the section. Uh add a section to the page. Well, we see the sentiments of page posts. What do you want exactly? Like let's do a summary of this. Like summary of positive versus negative posts and so on. >> Yeah, maybe it's like it shows a summary of the last four posts and it kind of shows your overall sentiment. >> Overall sentiment uh as a graph by cohorts. Nice. So, pretty simple natural language prompt. Not super special. >> No, I don't think it's about the the super technical prompts. It's really not about it unless it's something super specifically and you're super technical and you know exactly what you want. It's better to let the AI choose the technology for you. It's it's amazing to understand what it did, but I think it's separate things. one thing is directing it and second thing is understanding it and and then directing yourself in a way directing both of you but I don't go into any technical uh uh specs when when I'm prompting uh the main thing I want to do is to to get experience right and it's really complex by the way because worlds so many times have more than one meaning and most of the mistakes that happen that I saw is is miscommunication a lot of times it's just And it's the same in communication you have with the developer, but then the developer says, "Are you sure you mean that? It doesn't make sense and you talk again and the AI is really not good at telling you this does not make sense." >> So what's interesting about these prompts, right? Then the takeaway for PMs is you don't need to build a system prompt level prompt engineering. You don't need to say act as and here's a few closeshot examples and here's the frameworks to use and don't do this and do that. Instead, it's really about the clarity of what the feature is because you don't have that back and forth with developers. Is that right? >> That's totally right. I think developers would tell you when something you're saying is not correct and AI will take your choice correct or not. So it really if you're super technical and you do know what you're saying, maybe tell it what to do, but otherwise it's really better to explain very coherently what you want. And and it's really important because any anything that can be misinterpreted will statistically be misinterpreted. It's not every time. It's like talking to a genie and 99% of the time it will do what you want or 95% of the times. But if 5% of the time the genie will find everything you said that is flawed and will do the exact opposite of what you wanted and and we find that we do a lot of prompt engineering for our own prompts obviously running them many many times and and doing the dissection and the statistics and seeing what works and what doesn't and and a lot of times by the way after we've seen that something statistically doesn't pass well enough asking AI why and a lot of the times you just see a contradiction there's something that we miss something that can be understood in two ways and sometimes it will understand it in the that different way and you make it a bit more clear that issue goes away. So obviously it's it's not going to hit you every time. We we see it statistically when we're looking at hundreds thousand of of iterations if you're doing it 95% of the time even if you don't say exactly what you want it's going to understand you even if you're not totally clear but those five% of the time so can be so time consuming that it's really that's the main thing if you do want to do anything with your prompt beforehand take it to LLM and just ask it what are the contradictions what's unclear because again it's not about going technical it's about going Clarity is the key here and use LLMs if you need to to clarify your prompts. Now, while this is working, what's happening differently here in Dazzle versus Bolt or Lovable or Claude Artifacts? >> There's a number of things. First thing is that I'll go back to the server and and say that what Dazzle builds is a full-fledged server side application, server side and client side. That means a few things. It means that if you bring it to developers in your team, it'll just look like any other web applications that they saw. Nothing special, nothing proprietary. It also means that you can run it anywhere and you can take it to your computer and it'll run the same way or just host it yourself if you want somewhere. A second thing is obviously the inspection and the visual edits. Now, it's happening also while the AI is generating. It's not just for the user. All of the information that we know how to expose of the styles and the properties and and the state of the HTML and so on, all of the hidden state of the application, it's exposed to the AI and and I think that makes the AI so much smarter. There's so many things that just looking at the code and trying to understand why it fails, that's super hard. And if you look at the application with debugging tools, super easy. So basically the same debugging tools, the same inspection tools, the same overview tools that we give to users, they're all exposed to the AI as well and it makes for just makes it so much smarter. >> And one thing I would say that I personally noticed is that you're bringing a lot of that Wix expertise around having a really worldclass visual editor into here as well. We saw that a little bit and I think we'll go into that a little bit more. So let's take a look at what the AI built here. This is our second variation of the sentiment analysis. How do we think it did? >> I kind of like it. Obviously, it only gave us positive reviews because it's AI and but all in all, I pretty much like it. What do you say? What would you change? >> I like it. Like what I want to emphasize and triple click on for people is that what this tool unlocks is your ability to do these different solution explorations. We just did two for you guys, but you should think about along the two that you did, do a couple more iterations. So you could iterate this. You could say, "Hey, put in some negative data." You could say, "Hey, I currently think that this sentiment analysis, it's a little too big." Or maybe I think it should go below the page post. So you can do those little iterations, but then don't even stop there. We have two iterations. Why not come up with a third or a fourth? I think the magic of this tool is that it allows you to come up with three or four so quickly so that then you can really play with it and understand okay after playing with it which one of these is the best one. I totally totally agree. I think you want to first play around make a few variations then the one that you really like that one you want to get perfect but it's it's never the first step. >> Awesome. So maybe you can showcase for us now like the next level. Let's say we're sticking with one of these. You choose which one you like better. How are we going to go ahead and edit this further with natural language, with code, with component level changes. >> So Dazzle offers you a number of ways already in it. So let's look at this uh sentimental analysis element. So this is the entirety of the sentimental analysis. First of all, uh once it's selected, you can see that it's represented in the chat and the agent is obviously aware that this is the selected element. Now, here as well as in many other places, this connection is really really strong. It's something that we very proud of. It knows the exact place of the code. It knows the properties. One thing that you can see here, it's something that's I think important. It's, as I said, there's some level in app to do. think that PMS are going to need to do some understanding of the complexity. This is a part of this complexity. You can see here that this element basically in the HTML is both the sentimental analysis but it's also a card and in the end this card is a div. Now it's something that you won't see in other tools and it's it's something that is important because editing this div may means editing all the cards. Editing discard means discard instance and ending editing this sentiment analysis meaning means editing only this instance of sentiments analysis in your application. So this is one thing that you can see that is very different. Second thing that is interesting that whenever something has a properties that are interesting you can see them here. In this case you can see basically that it has data that is bound. It's not something that's here. It's not something that's simple to edit. But I can also basically see what the value is. So if I look at company posts, it got four company posts here. And if I really want to understand what's going on to see this is basically the data the component got. Now it's not something that you I open all the time. It's something that I open when I want to understand the data flow in the application. Usually it's part of of debugging. It's part of playing around and and understanding that my cart or in this case I didn't expect to see a different number of items. But in some cases you've seen four item and you expect to see 10. This basically shows you at what level is broken. You can go down the component tree and see where the data doesn't pass as you expected. >> Today's episode is brought to you by Jira product discovery.

The elements panel is something that is going to be familiar to a lot of uh not just developer I think also product managers and designer. It's basically much like any the dev tools that you see in any browser these days but it is much more connected to the code and much more connected to the application itself. So one thing you're going to see here that you're not going to see in the dev tools is again this separation between the the component and the instance because it is aware of the components. Second thing is that everything I do here if I edit it I I it's not a change that is transate. It's something that is immediately saved to my code and and you can immediately see it appearing in the left side. I I chose something that I I have no idea what I'm changing right now. I'm sure it's changing a color there somewhere, but uh maybe not a good idea. Let's let's take something like this. You can see that the background right now is a natural color. I can tweak it, but it's not just tweaking it like in the dev tools and then I refresh and it's not there. You can see the second that I'm doing it, there is a change to uh the the CSS file. And this CSS file in this case I'm going to discard you. We did something very ugly here. But it's immediate changes. Now it's important to understand most of the things I want to do that are simple editing. I'm going to do from here from this bar. But just understanding the structure and when I want to change it and where I want to change it. I'm going to need a tree because the HTML is a tree and most of the things it's really easy to select on stage but some of the times there's elements that have the same size that elements that are hiding each other. Uh there's a lot of stuff that you want if I want to actually even select just as context to the AI I'm going to need this tool. Second thing is as I said it's multi level. So we already saw some chat edits. I think we saw a number of uh visual edits from uh the top bar and a number of visual edits from here. Uh the third option that we have or fourth what is it? Uh is basically just to go to code wherever you want. So again if I want to look at this div I can inspect it like we did before but I can also view its code and it will take me immediately to the code of the element. And it's important to understand if I change it here, I I'll see change immediately on stage. Maybe >> for people who are kind of like they're not able to read this code, can you just walk us through how to read this here in the bottom right? >> Sure. So basically this is a react code. It's uh describes HTML. It describes the the structure that we see on stage, but it is not the structure. It can run many times. A lot of times it's going to be repeated uh it's going to run with different properties and show different data. So it is a representation of the dynamic HTML of your application. Some of the things you see here are going to look very similar to the element tree because again it's HTML. It's the same div. The main thing that's going to change is that you're going to see a lot of these uh squiggly lines here. Uh the curly braces mean it's an expression. It's something that is going to be dynamic. So this thing is a dynamic text in the middle of the div. And what I did is basically went after the curly braces and said I just want to add some text here. So say positive assessment. Now I can do it from here but it's definitely not my go to to do it from here. Also as a developer usually I'll do it from here. It makes a lot more sense. It makes it and you can see that immediately it does the same thing. Immediately it changes it in the code. It's exactly the same uh behavior as editing it in the code and and you talked before about cursor a bit. I think this is like the major difference. Cursor visual editing which I think it's an amazing feature. I'm not dissing it at all but I think it's important to understand how it works. It's basically a way of more than visually editing, visually prompting because everything you do is then passed as a this is what the user changed to the AI to then write it to your code. There's positive things to be said for it and negative things to be said for it. But I think it it the main thing it's lacking is the immediacy. It's the fact that I change something and this is how it's going to look. There's no second guessing. There's no going to add the LLM to try to implement it. And many times it'll get to 99% of what I wanted, but many times it won't. And I already did the work. So it feels like kind of a I don't know. It feels kind of annoying to be able to do this. I added the icon I wanted. I added the text I wanted. But then the LLM needs to do it again. >> I didn't know that about cursor. That's really interesting. >> It is really interesting. And it really changes what you can do in it. I'm just going to space it a bit here. >> And we used a couple technical definitions. For the people who got lost when we said those, can you just clearly define for us what is a div, what is a card, what is a component? >> Sure. So the way the browser works is uh something called a dry. It's basically the browser gets a document, a text document, an HTML document, and then it creates live nodes from it. These live nodes are what you see on stage. And the browser offers a number of of native nodes, a lot of them basically. It offers an input and offers an image and it offers a video, a lot of native elements. And for the mode stuff, that's what you want to use. It's it's the platform. it's the what's going to work best in it. But sometimes it's just not enough. It doesn't give you a for instance a tag input, a gradient picker. Just something that else that is you repeat a lot in your application. The main thing it doesn't give you out of the box is repeatability and the ability to create dynamic stuff. Now, it doesn't give it you out of the box, but they added a layer for that, and that's called JavaScript, which basically lets you play around with the same document model we discussed before, the same uh structure of HTML, the live one on stage, not the text that you loaded, but the second it's visually on stage, JavaScript can play around with it. It can add element, it can remove elements, it can do a lot of these things. and and that gave rise to a lot of frameworks like React that basically handle this dynamics uh the the dynamic data for you. And what they let you do is write something that looks a lot like HTML but is code and is dynamic renders again which is really important because an HTML page it renders once on the server and then it shows the static stuff. it shows what rendered. And with JavaScript and React applications and and other frameworks, you get something that's living and you get something else. You get the fact that you you start rendering on the client side and not on the server side. You start changing the HTML while it's in the browser. And that means that on the client side as well, you you don't want to rewrite this HTML all the time. you want to keep it componentized. And I think that's something that's really important. It's also it's not just important because of the the of the dynamic data. It's also really important just because you don't want to recreate the same visuals again and again and again. So components are basically taking a substructure based HTML uh divs and images and videos and whatnot and and grouping all all of that into something you can reuse that gets properties which are basically its data and and you can reuse across the page many many times without reloading this HTML many times without repeating the HTML in your application many times. So it's also a matter of of performance sometimes. Now the the core HTML for some reason they decided to call it a div for dividing stuff. It's it's basically a box in any design tool you you're going to meet. It's going to be called a box. There's some strange behavior for a box. By by default it's a vertical uh stack, but basically it's just the most native box you have in HTML. card is basically saying my box. I want it to always have the same borders. I want it to always have the same background and I want to reuse that. So card is basically also a box, but it's my box. So the reason I asked that question is I want all of you guys listening to be fluent with the code. Open up the code editor. Now, when should PMs be editing in code versus editing via prompting versus editing visually? >> I I don't think PMs should be ever editing in code. When when PMs get to the point where they have to edit in code, it's not their ideal flow. It means something did not work as expected. I think basically I I do a lot of visual edits. I I think a lot of visual edicts edits do make sense. It's it's a more clear way of editing the code. It's something that saves time. I don't need to understand where I am in the project. I can see it immediately on stage. I can experiment much faster. Obviously, I do write code, but it's because I'm used to writing code and and I find myself writing less and less and less code. I think the most important thing that you get from all the visual tools and the code tools and everything else that is not LLM based is the immediacy. It's the fact that you I I can go here and I can ask the AI to make this I I want a blue background or a green background for this section, the card header. It's going to take if it's a fast AI, it's going to take a few seconds and then I'm going to see the color that it shows. It does not make sense. This is something I want to do like this and see it immediately on stage. And also when I'm done, I want to know that it's done. That's it. It's not going to change. There's no other code writing going to go on before this. And and I think this is a this is a big advantage. It lets me play faster. And and basically what we all want is to play faster. Now the AI gives us an amazing run with this. for the initial generation for the big fins, it does it so much faster that I can do visually in code in whatever other way I could imagine. But for changing stuff later, it's it's not the fastest option. It's not the most fluent option. It's not the option that I can get faster at. Also, if you look at how designers work in in Figma or in people work in the software where they're really really proficient, they're lightning fast. They use all of the keyboard shortcuts. They do things so much faster than you than the 20 seconds, 10 seconds it takes you to first prompt it and then wait for the AI to do it. It it makes sense for a lot of things. Don't get me wrong, but for some things it just doesn't. >> So stick to visual editing for the most part. I don't know if for the most part it is taking maybe most uh more of my time because uh because when I'm sending ti to do something I I usually do something else but I don't think most of the definitely not most of the code being written by me is done visually most of it is done by I >> got it. What are the biggest mistakes PMs make when editing? I think the the there's a number of things. Uh I I'll start by answering because it's a multiple I think it's there's many places I can take this question. I'll take it to prompt it first because I think editing through the uh the AI has so much complexities in itself and so many places to be better at to to or you can go wrong at and you should really be careful about it. And I think the first thing is something we already hinted on. It's that basically you write in a prompt. Maybe it understood you, maybe it didn't. And then it's going to run and do it and it's going to run so fast and it's going to be so eager to do exactly what it understood wrong from what you said. And I think that's like the one big thing that I see. And and and this is by the way why it's really important to go to plan mode. Go to discuss mode. Tell the AI I'm going to do this. What do you think? How do you understand me? Like you would with the developer sometimes. It's not for anything. I wouldn't do it if I ask it to add something small to an existing page or something like that. If I'm changing something that's major, I'm going to have discussing. I'm going to discuss it for with it first. and and when only when the answer I get back makes real sense and I'm going to make my uh questions such that it's not clear what it needs to answer to please me right if if I say uh something like do you think I can do this yeah sure you can do this I'd ask what do you think should I do this and it's a totally different question you're going to get a different answer and it's really really important now another thing that I see is that people take uh the time to do research and then they create huge huge huge prompts and they pass it to the AI as one step and there's tools to go around it in all kinds of AIS. We we all build around this and build around the problem of context which is like the major problem when building AI tools but I think a lot of the times what we do is not going to be as good as what you do when you build your phone beforehand. So this is like an example of this is that I could say in this example that we did now I could put everything including the image in one prompt and say just add a feature and it's probably going to do a less not as good as job on any one of the parts. AI has context switches just like people it's more problematic with AI because when we have a context switch we usually stop and we think and it doesn't it just works with the wrong data. So I think those are like the three main things that I would say when when prompting. >> So we've built pretty good prototype. How do we make this the next level? How do we make this more complex? Whether it's multiple pages or hooking up into APIs. Where do we go from here to make this a real world PM prototype? >> It's a really good question. It's everything is possible. So I think the real question is what do we want to show? Because again it's it's a server with a very smart AI that really can connect anything we would want here. I don't know what do you have any idea of what you would want to connect to this? >> I think multi-page application is the next step right because most your prototypes they're not just going to exist on one page. In fact I think one of the peak powers of prototyping is we used to build a PRD then the designers and developers would go build it and they would learn all these edge cases. they would have all these questions. So one of the most powerful things to do in prototype is to actually build out the endto-end flow actually look at everything. So one edge case we already know right here is what if you have less than three or four posts. That's one edge case that came to our mind. And then a flow that comes is well we have these post boxes these cards essentially post one post two post three post four. Perhaps a user might want to click into them. So then we should probably design the experience. And so maybe that's the next step we can do is what happens if somebody clicks on post one box or post two box. >> Okay let's let's do it. Let's add uh what do you think it should open the sentiment page or the post page? >> I guess it should really open the post but below it the post instead of just showing the comments it should show the comments along with how it coded the sentiment. >> Okay. So let's uh give it a prompt. Basically uh when a score card is clicked. Go to a new dynamic page. Join that post and have an explanation. of how the sentiment was collected for it. Something like that. Perfect. As we said before, the clarity in this prompt is really important. So, if we say how the sentiment was collected for it, it's going to deliver one thing versus if we said, "Show me the coding of the comments." So, be really careful with the prompt, but I like this prompt. So, let's go with that. Okay. And maybe like uh and a way of seeing the comments according to sentiment. Okay. So, while it's working here, we are building essentially a highfidelity prototype. Now, it's even clickable. You can even go see other pages. When should PMS be building a highfidelity prototype? >> Well, it's it's really a matter of of what you're trying to achieve. And I'm not just talking about the feature. It's what you personally are trying to achieve. A lot of cases, a feature doesn't have the buying of the organization yet. And and I fidelity is is a tool for selling. It's a way of of showing everybody in the organization or the people that are the decision makers, the people that affect the decision maker how amazing this feature is going to be. And it's so works so much better with high fidelity. It has to look nice for that. If I added something ugly here, it'll be really hard to to to look at the functionality and not think about it. So I think high fidelity is is first of all it's a tool for selling the idea and this is this is also important for solo entrepreneurs. A lot of times you actually use that to get an investment but also for PMs it's it's the same the bigger the organization it's going to be harder to sometimes convince people that the feature is necessary that it's important that it's something that needs to happen now and and this is a great tool for this cell. Second thing is that after you finish the ideation phase and you want to put it in front of users, usability is work a lot less with low fidelity and you have to have the entirety of the product in a way in low fidelity. If something is low fidelity in the middle of something that's high fidelity that is one second I I'll just tell it. Okay, do it. So as I said there's basically one thing is about selling it. Second thing is about usability and the fact that usability does not work well on low fidelity products and definitely not on Frankenstein products where you have something that's high fidelity and you patched on something that's low fidelity that works even even less. So in in my experience and in what we're doing here, it's basically we do a lot of lowfidelity ideation step prototypes, it's usually us that play around with them, just the team and then when we choose one, it goes to high fidelity. It goes to high fidelity usually in Vibe coding tools. The idea behind it is exactly to put it in front of users as fast as we can and both talking to users that we already have and getting them on calls and try this in usability. Especially if they asked for the feature, it's a godsend. It's really if you have somebody that knows what he wants, he knows exactly how he wants the feature and you can let him play around with it and say, "Yeah, okay, that's what I meant." It's it does two things. It both keeps it the users super motivated and it really gives you the strongest validation of the feature that you can get. >> Are there any um cool workflows? I think like people these days they're like taking some of these prototypes onto a site like useresting.com just to get like 10 people to use it or something. Are there any of those types of workflows you would recommend PMs pick up? >> Definitely uh uh anything you can do to get people to play around with the product. But again, ideally, it's not just some people, it's your users. So there's really there's really no way of going around and there shouldn't be a way of going around having a personal contact to the most advanced users you have, to the most engaged users you have, to those that are willing to talk to you basically, and getting them to try it. It makes so much more sense. and and you really you don't need anything but uh uh to jump on a video call with them and to have something published that they can play with a prototype. It's as simple as that. So again uh I'm I'm maybe you're in the start maybe you need user testing for something like that maybe uh but ideally it's your users and and you're the one bringing them on for this. >> Yeah, you're going to get much better feedback from them. So I think a key takeaway for all the product leaders listening is if you aren't giving your PMs an AI prototyping tool and the ability to go talk to customers like that, have a few customers on speed dial, you are really handicapping them in this era. And if you are a PM who doesn't have that capability, go make the case, send them this video, but on top of that, try to build this into your normal workflow that before I build a feature, I'm going to go get a high fidelity prototype. some of the users that I have on speed dial or who specifically requested this feature. I'm going to go put this in their hands. That's when you get the real benefits of this workflow. So, I think it's completed. Can we see how the multi-page application is looking? >> It's just validating the pages. I think we can already see the new page. Yeah. Okay. So, >> because it's validating maybe. >> Yeah. Yeah, it is fixing stuff. Yeah. Still, it's almost done. So to summarize what we just covered for people, what we've done is we've built a highfidelity multi-page prototype and we're going to see the results in a second in order to reduce usability risk, in order to sell a feature, in order to explore an idea. And these skills, what they're allowing you to do is a lot of the classic stuff we've talked about as a PM before AI prototyping tools, but just much better at a much higher fidelity. We used to have all departments for this like we still have it's not but it used to be free developers doing all of the prototypes for so many features in weeks a lot of them starting out in low fidelity even before AI in as functional prototypes. Okay. So one second I'll go to preview and >> there we go. That's what we requested. So most people watching they might say I have some visual edits or I have some ideas on the layout to change. That's the point really is by doing this first prompt simple prompt. You can go ahead and visually edit and then you can really build this up. So let's say they did all the visual edits. How do you hand this off to engineers after prototyping? There's a number of things I can do here. And I think the main thing is that it's just standard code, but it's it's not even about the code because most of the time what really a developer wants is clarity of how you want it to behave and just sending the prototype over does really 90% of the work. Second thing is that where something is more specific, more complex, more it can save him a lot of time, a lot of the job, a lot of the work to basically just download this project, put it next to the project he's currently building and tell cursor to just copy the experience from there. So a lot of the end of now it's basically in a way a code to agent. It's the the developer is using the his own AI based tools and they can basically especially if you're using a like the flow before we said that we said before where you starting out from a template and then you have some changes to it having the template and the changes just tells the AI basically okay this is what the user edited and and basically if you start from a template it's going to get that it's basically the history of this project. It already has that once you download the project as as kit information. So just doing that and that's basically what we do. We download the project, we put it next to the project we're working on and for us it's Dazzle and we tell the AI copy the feature inside, copy the interaction inside. Now I'm not saying that it's 100%. Uh definitely with complex products, the developer is going to need to wire some of the things probably to see that they work correctly and it's really dependent on how the developer works with AI because projects that work a lot with AI and developers that work a lot with AI, a lot of the information of how a feature needs to be written in to their product, it's already there. So just having the information of the code itself and the prototype that's usually the end of you want and and a lot of it can be automated. >> So I think it basically you just hit the publish button and then you share that link with them. It's as simple as that. >> Well it's that it's also letting them get the code if they want it which obviously is also something you can do here. Uh we're adding git integration really really really soon. At that point it'll be much easier to give them just the g uh that you created. So they can connect that basically to their ID and it can read the code from there. It's not as if they even need to download it anymore. Second thing is that we saw here before in the dev tools this is basically the project. This in the entirety of the file system of the project. I can always just download it as a folder to my computer. And I can also just take any file that I want. If I have a spec or anything else that I want to just have in the project, just drag it in there. It'll be added obviously. Now, you talked about uh workflow before and I think there's one thing that I really is important in in my workflow with AI and I think is also something that a lot of PMs are going to need and it's basically the idea of storing some of the data of the information of the specs of different parts of the system in the system and it gives you a superpower. It's basically hitting that discuss mode we talked about before discussing an entire spec or entire aspect of the system with the AI and then say just saying okay now write that to file and that's an asset that is also really important for the end the developer or is AI are going to get it with the rest of the files it's not something else but it's also really important for your iteration work with the AI because you just have points of data that you and refer to it. You can manage some of the context when it gets a bit bigger by yourself. You have for instance in this case we could say just what is a sentiment analysis and how does it work even if it's not there yet having this information and something that's separate from the code means that now if I do another variation I do another feature I expand the feature all of these places I already have the context. >> Very important point and I actually want to double click on that a little bit. Let me share my screen here. So, one of the hot topic questions that everybody is asking me is when do I use an AI prototype versus a PRD? Do I have a prototype and a PRD? So, what is the role of the PRD? Now, >> that's a really good question. I I think first of all, it's PRDS are are really important, but also really notorious. They have a number of problems in them. First of all is that it's a lot of text that people sometimes skim over and they miss some of the parts. Second thing is that everybody knows it takes a thousand words to describe one picture and an application if you put it down to pictures is like a thousand. So there's so much text and you're going to not going to cover it all. Some things you're going to take as self-explanatory, a lot of them because that's the way it works. And and I think the prototype and the PD, they're not coming to replace each other. But for most people, they're going to play around with the prototype and understand most of the things from the prototype. And in a way, the PRD becomes something that is more useful for the AI even. Now, I'm not saying it's not part of your deliverables. It is part of your deliverables. uh it is important. It's something that you need to see that makes sense. But if you do what we said before, if you manage it as something as part of your project, the PRD as as something that is a living part of of the system you're building in a way, and you make sure that it is part of the prototype, then it's going to improve your prototype because one thing I can tell you is that the AI is going to probably read it and not skim it. and and it means that it's going to it's going to create the sort of fidelity or mirroring between the PRD and the prototype. Now, it's not that that we don't read the PRDs anymore, but they come second. They come as something that's for for the edge cases, for the things that I didn't cover in the prototype. It'll cover a lot of things that maybe didn't make sense. you talked about uh before the edge cases the the empty screen in the case of the sentiments and so on. Some of these fins are not going to be represented in your prototype. Right? We have a second edge case which is basically we have too many posts. We didn't cover it and it's I don't think that it's that important that we didn't cover it. But if it comes to a developer at that point between the PRD and the prototype, you don't want him to have any questions. I think that's like a as a a checklist for yourself. If you have anything that you feel like you need to say after somebody already read the PRD and played around with the prototype, then something is missing. So it's it's really a way both of covering all the edge cases and making sure that they're there. And it's important to understand that code costs more to develop costs code costs more to maintain and to tweak and text is cheaper both in your time your time to debug it because you don't need to debug text. you just need to read it. If it's an application, whenever you do a prompt, you want might want to check different parts of it to see that everything works as expected and so on. It's so much simpler with text. So, I would say cover the main 90% flows with the prototype and make sure that all of the edge cases are in the PRD. >> I really like this distinction. Cover your 90% flows in your prototype and then have all your edge cases in your PRD. So that PRD plus prototype leads to no questions. >> Exactly. >> So to review everything we covered for you guys today, we talked about when should a PM use AI prototyping versus other methods. Ideation to feel production ready to sell an idea to reduce usability risk. And we talked about this ideal workflow. You're going to explore the problem space. You're going to define a feature. You're going to match it to your design system like we did in step one. You're going to explore three to four divergent solutions. We explored two today. You're going to visually edit the best solution. We showed you how to do that. Then you're going to test it with real people. ideally your own users and then you're going to share that prototype with a developer team. Is there anything else in this workflow PM should keep in mind? >> Have fun. I mean, >> have fun with it. >> Yeah. I mean, you got such amazing creation tools. I I think about how much work I needed to do to create my first flash game, my first interactive content, and you just got like the most magical genie that can build things for you. So, yeah, have fun with it. And it's it's really about the variations as well. It's not being afraid to have fun and do a lot of variations. >> Yes, I would really emphasize this point. Three to four could even be low depending on what stage you are and what type of feature how important that feature is. So before I let you go, Nadav, I have a couple hot questions for you. Hot question number one is why did you build Dazzle as a separate company and not inside of Wix? >> It's a there's so many answer to this one. Uh, Wix is a giant company and it's the most amazing giant company. I I had so much luck uh being a founder of this incredible company. It is also a big company and big companies in many ways especially public companies they are limited in how fast they can move. Wix is amazing in that regard by the way. It moves really fast but it's no startup. So I think in this time where everything is so volatile and changing so fast uh I wanted to get on top of it and and that's that's one of the reasons. Second reasons reason reason is the team that I have with me. I have the most amazing team of 30 people. Some of them working with me more than 10 years. Built a number of the of the Wix editors. Really amazing people. The the superstar developers and superstar well everything you can imagine in a startup. And some of them have been with me for as I said more than 10 years. But they really Wix is 20 years old almost or just now. So if you look at it, when they joined Wix, it was already kind of a big company and we love working together. I don't want to stop working with them, but I think they they should have their own company by this point. So it's also about the people and giving them the opportunity because I think as a startup they have much more ownership and much more stake in the game and then if they win a bigger cash out also. Uh so so this is I think the second thing. Third thing is that when I look at what we're building and and where we're taking it and what we believe uh at Tazzle, it's very different from Wix. Wix is has always been about simplicity, about targeting do it yourself, but also do it for me, but not uh the professional high-tech community as such. And I think what we're doing with Dazzle aims a lot more at professionals. So it made sense in that regard also to split it. >> And the final hot question here. If we see the progress that this has made since Chad GPT released 3 years ago, it's been phenomenal. If you forecast out three, five more years, we can only expect this to get much much better. Is there a point where AI starts to replace developers or replace product managers? What's your forecast for the future? And specifically like how should PMs be preparing themselves for whatever is happening in the next 3 to 5 years with AI? >> Well 3 to 5 years I don't know if AI is going to replace developers. It's going to replace some very simple things development tasks in a way. What I think it does is it blurs the the lines between developers and just techsavvy people. if you want to become texts a sav is somebody that wants to be tax a somebody that wants to bother and understand a bit about what's going on inside his system and really because writing code is is not a limiting factor anymore. I think what PMs really need to do is is level up the skill of understanding what they're building because I I know it's again it's talking dirty because the PMs don't want to be developers and and they're right. It's something different. did something else and and they're totally it's it's such an important and interesting job to just bring in the input and design the feature. But I think sometimes now with these superpowers you can just become unblocked. I see our product managers at Dazzle they're pushing code into the main project as well. not huge things not like starting out and and I don't know not building a huge new feature but if we want to change the publish dialogue if we want to change the media gallery if you want to not just visual stuff sometimes you want to add a link to some other uh back office we have and stuff like that this is done done by the product managers and the designers not by the developers many of the times and and it's going to grow more right the the when writing code is is not a problem. In a way, the developers become the gatekeepers. They're in charge of making sure the code still makes sense in the end, but they're not going to they're not going to be the only contributors of code. So, one thing I'd suggest is level up. It's basically understand that the fact that you're not a developer doesn't mean that you don't write code anymore. I mean, obviously, you don't type the code, right? But you don't even have to type anything. just put it on speaker and and talk to it. But but you can contribute code and you should contribute code and it should be something small at the start. I think it's it's a level up that all of your organization is going to see. It's not going to be simple maybe uh politically just making the organization accept that PMs are starting to put in code. But I think it's so worth it and if you get your organization to do this, it's a huge level up. And also there's something you can do to start getting ready for it which is basically sit down with whatever AI tool you want that has access to your project to the actual project that your company is working on and start asking it question ask it for a highlevel diagram ask it for whatever you want to basically understand bit more about the architecture I think it's it's a muscle it's really something you can practice you can uh look And you can also practice it on different applications. If you build something in whatever vibe coding tool you want. Uh not all of them have the amazing tools Dazzle have for looking at at the output, but all of them have an amazing AI developer that can read the code and tell you stuff about it. And I think it's it's it's going to teach you how to talk to the developers better also, right? and just talking to the AI about the code a bit, asking it about the big concept, it's that's going to teach you so much. And if you do it on your project, that's amazing. You're going to have a common language with the developers in the team that you never had before. >> What a great way to end it, guys. We just walked through using Dazzle as a case study, but more importantly, all the fundamental skills for AI prototyping. We talked about the importance of not just jumping into your AI prototype, but exploring the problem space. Once you actually build your AI prototype, making sure it conforms to your design system, making sure you're exploring different divergent solutions and then testing it with your users. I promise you, if you implement the things that Nadav taught you today into your work, you will be a better PM. More of your features will be successful. They will have a greater impact. So, go out there, stop watching now, start using a tool, whatever tool you have access to. Hopefully, you have access to a tool like Dazzle. You can get a free month of Dazzle if you use my code which is below in the description. So, don't let that be your blocker. Get started today and I'll see you in the next episode. >> Can I say one more thing, Akash? >> Yes. >> Okay. So, one thing I if I can sum up and say, we keep working on new features. If you come and use Dazzle and you want to see it from the other side how this usability looks, don't just use the coupon. Give us a holler on Discord on the email wherever you want. Talk to us and you'll get to see one of these experiences from the other side which is I think super interesting as well. >> Yeah. Take both sides of the chair, give them some feedback and see it on the other end. Thanks so much Nadav. >> Thank you. It's been a pleasure. Hi everyone. I hope you enjoyed that episode.
