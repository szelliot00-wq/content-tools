This is a Trello Chrome I built with Diat. Uh, it has everything boards, lists, cards. [music] I can use AI to generate boards content like lists and cars with card descriptions. So, I do not have to start from scratch. [music] I can reorganize items, add labels, uh, mark items as complete [music] or in progress, rename labels. So, all the basic features that you would expect from [music] Trello. Uh, I can also drag and drop elements, cards, and lists. [music] And I can also generate an a background and in this case uh this is something that that fits my wedding. Uh finally basic [music] features like support admin documentation so that we have a ready to use website and of course authentication. Let's demonstrate how to work with the ad by adding a feature to mark ports on the dashboard as favorite. And this should be indicated by the star. Right now it is thinking. So let's wait a [music] moment. We are using the Mi 2.5 Pro. Okay, it is making a changes. So we will see in a moment how [music] it works. Yeah, I [music] approved the changes and I should see sometimes you need to restart this environment but usually you [music] just see the changes uh right away. I previously configured my account and my email address [music] and I have some boards on the list. Unfortunately, I see that they are not uh marked as favorite or actually they are marked as favorite but this star is not displayed. So, I don't like it. Let's fix it. Cards should be immediately [music] reordered. Plus, I want to see those stars all the time for my favorite cards. Need a swinking. Let's give it some time. and approve the changes after they are done. As you see, I'm not using a code and I'm using [music] a free uh Germany API. Okay, stars. It seems that stars are visible, but they do [music] not appear exactly in the place they should be. So, I have changed the model to the mini 2.5 flat. This is a small modification, and [music] I would like to see those stars in the top right corner. that would [music] be more intuitive for the users. I believe the mini [music] 2.5 flash is much much faster and also it doesn't have uh limits like the mini 2.5 Pro. So I use it for all the small changes. Sometimes [music] you need to click keep going but overall it is good for making those small adjustments. approve and let's test it. Yeah, we can see the cars where they should be. So, it works correctly. Perfect.
