Hey, since January 2025, I've been recommending Lovable as the best no code solution for building real full sackups. But I have also emphasized one thing. While working with Lovable doesn't require coding, it does require basic technical knowledge. Recently, someone in the community recommended B 44. I was skeptical, but I decided to test it. Base 44 turned out to be the simplest all-in-one solution for those who want to build prototypes, full stack apps, or even minimal products. I will demonstrate building a rack chatbot with base 44. By the way, I'm Pavo's digital avatar, but the demonstration was recorded by Pavo. Let's dive in. Okay, I hope this will be a quick demo. I would like to demonstrate how you can use base 44 to create full stack apps um or prototypes or NDPs even easier and faster than in lovable. And for that I will create a simple chat that uh uses a rack assistant defined in OpenAI. I will explain different things during the presentation but first let's start with the assistant. So assistant it's like a custom GPT but defined in open AAI platform so that you can access it from programmatically from other apps. I have included very simple instructions. So this is a product management expert. It always needs to search files before providing the response and I can add my files. So my data source to retrieve just by dragging and dropping files for example from my local desktop. There are also other options. I will leave the default configuration settings and yeah our assistant is ready. Uh we have the ID here and we will use this ID in base 44 prompts. Um good. The next step is to go to base 44 and describe what we want to build. And uh I would like to build a simple chat app that calls OpenAI assistant. Um okay, the layout is simple. Use cases. User needs to sign in. Sign up. Sign up with Google. After signing in, they can uh start the new chat, browse, continue, previous threads or sign out. And for now, it's all I will only include the default styling instructions. So, this glass morphism thing is uh popular recently, so let's use it. It automatically added the styling instructions. I only will add that I like uh pink shades. Okay. And right now it is created creating a new uh a new app. Uh what is important here is that uh B 44 will not ask you about any database settings, database connection, connection strings because it uh hides all this complexity related to database like Sappabase um behind the friendly user interface. And even though Lovable is user friendly, it requires you to understand different components what role level security is. sometimes look um in the database to understand the tables, understand the relationships. You don't have any of this in base 44 and the base 44 also provides built-in uh Google and email authentication. Uh so you do not have to create any clerk account. You do not have to configure anything in Google cloud console. It just works by default. And also they have uh ready to use integrations like integration with open AI. Um I need to use my custom open AI key. But if I wanted to rely on a generic um LLM, I could use just base 44. Uh there is something like integration messages credits and without paying anything extra uh to open EA. Okay. I have my friendly assistant. Uh let's test it just to make sure that this basic functionality works. So uh the new chat is [Music] hello just to test it. Uh yeah. Hi there. How I can assist you today? It's not ideal. When I pressed new chat, it didn't use my first message as the first message in Yeah, instead of asking uh it opened a new panel. Yeah, I guess it's okay. We could fix it a little bit, but overall uh that's okay. The next thing I want to do is to instead of uh relying on this gen general uh openi integration I want to call my own assistant. So to do that I will go go to the workspace settings app settings and be before we call open AI with our custom key we want to do it securely. So it means that uh we cannot store this key in the front end. This must be um an app secret and this app secret can be only accessed on the back end. It sounds complex but it's simple in practice. Uh all you need to remember is to enable backend functions and then um ask base 44 to use your custom open AI key and uh call that integration uh securely inside this function. And I have already a prompt. So move open AI call to the back end and use my custom API key. Open AI API key when calling my assistant. Okay. Uh ensure we strictly follow OpenAI version 2 assistance API. And this is information I found on uh Open EI page. And this is this seems like um uh a new thing. So uh some apps uh loable and base 44 included sometimes struggle with it. Uh so I just created a prompt to to guide the model rather than fixing the errors later. Uh we want to use the new API and we want to include this special header in our requests. Okay, it asked me about my open API key. So, we are replacing the built-in integration with our custom key. Uh, I will remove it later. You will see part of this key. Uh, I will remove this key before publishing this video. And here I can save my secret so that users accessing this app um will not see it. Uh, everything happens in the back end. And right now it is creating a secure function that will access this uh this uh secret uh on the back end. So and and and again uh in case you use lovable and you use and I really like lovable uh in case you call you execute edge functions uh those edge functions are executed by in superbase which is like betat as a service but here uh edge functions are executed by base 44. So this is their custom implementation. They do it securely and again you will not see any of the settings. Of course you can access you can see because we have an access to the source code. You will see the source code but you cannot manage those functions when they are deployed. Everything is hidden. Everything is simplified. So all you need to to remember is to um when creating an integration use integration keys and execute the integration logic securely on the back end. Uh so that's the only way that the user cannot modify the logic and cannot access your secrets. Uh let's test it. I will ask okay the loading chat what is north star metric uh it is typing so that's a good sign um if it crashes it crashes crashes immediately when it cames to openi integrations uh let's hope we will see the result in a moment okay we got the response uh it quoted some source. So it means that it actually can access uh rack uh vector store because rack is about retrieval and generation. So it's the entire process. Uh but uh it doesn't make sense to to quote those sources. Those are internal files. So I will ask to remove anything between uh like uh source include those elements we don't need them the user cannot access those files either way and uh assume open AI responses are simple markdown uh response text uh is simple markdown format it's properly see the attachment and here I will include the screenshot so uh just so the model can understand the problem. Okay, no issues to fix. Okay. Uh it understood that this is about removing sitation. That's good. And the second thing is uh markdown. Let's see if if it will do that. Of course, you can you can uh refine uh small details like ask to remove the strat ID or assistant ID so that it is not visible for the user. But I do not want to spend time on it right now. This is not about uh polishing the UI. But uh demonstrating what you can easily do and you can refine those tiny details later. Uh if that works, uh I will go to permissions and demonstrate Google authentication. So let's hope it will work this time. Okay, let's start a new chat. Uh, again I will ask what is what is so here. Um, okay there is some error. I'm not sure why. So, we need to fix the problem. Okay, maybe once again perhaps the app was uh during the refresh the changes were being deployed. So, that's why we got this error. Now, it is thinking and okay, we have the objective. So we have formatting, we have uh bold text, we we could precise some details like bullet points but I will not uh spend time on that. Okay. So we have our rack chatbot uh that connects to open uses our custom um assistant that can access files performs retrieval and generation. So this is a rack chatbot with custom user interface. uh how we can authenticate, how we can secure this this this app. Uh all we need to do is to go to security and here we have two types of entities that are stored in the database. Chat threads and chat messages. Uh and all I need to do all I uh want from this app is that users can see their chats and their messages but cannot see chats and messages created by other users. Uh to do that uh I can just create access rules a visual and for the read it will be that only creator can read uh information. Save and similarly for chat messages uh only creator can can access those messages. Safe security rules. Uh that's that's it. Uh let's make sure that where it is that we have probably in the settings that we have uh Google authentication enabled. It is enabled by default but we also have this email password authentication. That's fine. Um let's publish our app and test it. Now of course we have not defined uh fields like created by updated by uh ID and so on. Uh because every entity whether you show this information or not every element in uh base 44 already has that information. So you can use that when defining uh different policies. Uh I will use Google authentication and I will use I will login as the first user. So this is this pubble hurin atgmail.com. Uh I have no chats. So let's start a new one. Um how are you? Whatever just to demonstrate that I have this chat message here and I hope that we will get a response. If not, uh h uh what is north star. It's a good sign it didn't crash immediately. But let's let's wait a little bit. Oh, we actually got the response. So, it seems that those changes good changes have been having propagated. I will stop. Uh I will revert changes. We Yeah, we don't want to change anything. Uh okay. And just to demonstrate that a different user will not see my messages. So when I sign in as pavore and gmail com I can access my messages my threads. when I sign out, we can adjust this uh UI. Uh if I sign in as a different user, uh I will see messages that I'm using in this preview window because here I'm also sign in as by default as uh Pavo at product compass PM. So the same messages, the same threads. And when I sign out and sign in again with my first Gmail account as you see we have again we have this context that is unique to the user. Okay. So just to wrap it wrap it up, we have used base 44 to create a full stack application. Uh this full stack application has a database. Uh and I can see the data here. It's not very complex but we have a chat threads and chat messages inside those threads. uh the data is secured with uh those security rules. So for example uh only creator can read and update and delete items. We can also define more complex rules and different rules for reading and writing. But basically uh yeah everything can can be defined here. Uh we can also define roles that depend on some fields um inside the object. So for example, if there was a field with um it was a leaf request and there was a manager as one of the fields, then we could assign permissions to that manager so that they can edit or approve the form like a typical workflow inside organizations. Um we have access to the code. We cannot uh we cannot we can edit this code. And what is nice here is that unlike in many other environments you have um autocomplete here and the the editor is suggesting changes if you really need to code for some reason. You can also export this to GitHub. Uh the export is one way and exported code uses base 44 libraries. So even though you can export it you if you want to completely get rid of base 44 you will would have to edit it yourself. It's not the case with uh Lovable when you export the project in Lovable. So first you don't export it, you sync it to two directionally and you can use different tools together with lovable to edit your project. Uh another thing uh is that um when working with base 44 you cannot control uh moving the apps between environments. So there is a database. You cannot branch this database. You cannot branch the code. You can copy the entire codebase with database. But this is not a good way to move data between environments. So uh in my opinion, B 44 is a good solution. If you want to create some simple apps for internal use, then uh perhaps you do not need to worry about um branches so much. Um the data is uh um you can export the data. So that's the only option uh or you can use the API to export it and import the data uh from those options. The code is versioned automatically though it doesn't happen in GitHub unless you export and update your GitHub repository regularly. Uh but you have access to to the version history here. You can just select the version and uh restore one of those versions. Uh an interesting thing also are visual edits you might know from lovable. So we can select an element and adjust the styles like classes, adjust spacing, adjust background color. Though you cannot edit content that way. And uh so you cannot change text for text. You either need to open the code or just ask the editor, ask the model to to change specific texts. And uh yeah, what else? You can add a custom domain. You can buy a domain or get instructions how to connect your own. Basically configure DNS records. And you have a built-in API. That's also a nice thing so that you can call different operations like for example creating charts uh retrieving chat messages programmatically and if you create an app like maybe a different type of the application like for example uh certificates management uh then you could uh basically perform the same operations that you perform in the user interface like reading records or creating new records programmatically and for example will connect Zapper or connect Nan workflow so that it is easy to integrate that with other systems. Um, good for prototyping, good for quick demonstrations, good for limited internal applications, and perhaps good for MVPs where you do not need to worry so much about before you get the first customers, you don't need to worry a lot about how I will update upgrade those customers, what I should do if I have 1 million people on production. Uh, it's a good problem to have. Uh although if we really seriously think about creating a product uh that um you can easily switch to another editor and you can better manage the application life cycle I would rather focus on loable but for people who perhaps don't have the tech background uh and want to simplify maximally simplify everything related to creating those simple solutions and also can leverage the built-in integrations for example with uh OpenAI that can be a good solution. Okay, hope that helps. Thanks.
