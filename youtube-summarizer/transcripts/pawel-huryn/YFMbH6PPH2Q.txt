Every moment you spend running after something that's not high impact is a minute you've wasted right in in doing something that's not high leverage. And once you've aligned everyone and everything to those highly leveraged opportunities, now you can think in terms of simplification. Very often when we think about creating value, we think about doing more and we think of adding things and and that's a fundamental shift. And so if you continue to be supply constrainted, if you continue to be in that scarcity mindset, then you're missing out on the massive opportunity for growth. The military is for me as an organization the only one that has the highest stakes because they operate at a scale that almost no business in the world can operate at. And if we do that, if we play to our strengths, to our leverage, right, I think then humans with machines together will create a lot more value than we're able to create. No, I have read a lot of product management books as you can see in the background. That's probably one of the best. Hi, Pavo here. In this episode, I interview Retavan, a technology leader who over the past decade has built and scaled datadriven solutions that have impacted billions of euros, also known as a slassog guy. His new book, Data Impact, is coming out on April 29th. We discuss why digital transformation legacy companies is a myth. Why we should focus on value creation not just technology. The slasso framework to grow and to win. How grouping can lead to poor decision making. Military strategies that can provide valuable insights for product managers. How to avoid wasting resources on low impact activities collaboration between humans and machines and much more. Let's dive in. Hey. Hi Vavan. It's awesome to have you here. I have read your book data impact and I think that it is going to be a bestseller soon. We have talked about the growing weight list and videos that there are thousands of views on YouTube. So how does it feel to see so many people excited about your work already before the book is published? Thanks Paul. Great to be here. Um yeah, I'm actually really happy about this because um the reason why I wrote this is really to to see impact on the ground and and I think the momentum so far has been really gratifying and thanks a lot for reading the book and I'm really excited about our discussion. Great. So let's start with the first strong idea for me from the book. This is you clearly state that digital transformation in legacy companies is a myth. That's a strong statement. So can you explain that to us? Yeah, sure. I mean one of the sort of I think in terms of imagery it's flawed because when you use the word transformation you know you think of some kind of industrial caterpillar you know turning into a digital butterfly and the thing is if you're a legacy business you know a traditional sort of nonsoftware native business what is important is to understand that the reason you exist is because you've customers and because you're delivering value to to those customers in the industrial paradigm right where where legacy businesses were were born and then there have been two new paradigms that have emerged since, you know, one is the digital paradigm. So, basically everything having to do with software and the next paradigm, you know, that's kind of very recent and that's going to continue to grow is the datadriven paradigm. Um, and what is important is to understand that you're not going to transform, right? All you can do is think about what value are you offering to your customers in each of these paradigms. That should be your objective because talking transformation is like telling a hunter they should transform into a farmer or telling a farmer they can transform their farm into a into a factory. That does not make any sense, right? So what you can you know what you can tell a hunter is hey if you have a plot of land you can farm something right? What you can tell a farmer is if you have some place you can set up a factory for example to process you know your crops right? So either to make flour or to dry your fruits, you know, in and c or candy them and whatever, right? But like you have to think in terms of value uh value creation and not in terms of some kind of tweaking here and there. That's not going to move the needle. That makes perfect sense and I also I've always been uh unsure about the term and what it really means. I'm happy that you share uh similar view. You talk about being legacy business being essential. If I remember correctly, it's that you cannot eat where on reside inside in software. What was the specific experience that you decided to write a book specifically about those companies and does it mean that the book is only for product managers, product leaders or founders that are focused on that area or also others can benefit from it? Yeah, that's a very good questions. In fact, I've been operating for the past decade. You know, since I completed my masters in math and machine learning, I've worked across what you could broadly call legacy businesses or legacy industries. So, starting with banking, energy, insurance, industrials, real estate, etc. And I saw I mean I saw a lot of things there that just kind of felt like they needed to be that they needed to be addressed. And I'd say I say the book is kind of born of in a very deep place starting with scars, right? because you just a lot of things that happen in life just end up making you feel frustrated making you feel unhappy about what could have been but also a lot of lot of learning and I kind of right right at the you know in in the first chapter that I'm standing you know on on the shoulders of giants and so I think there's just a lot of frameworks a lot of ideas that I kind of weave together and a lot of operating experience in the sense of I try to keep it super practical super implementable super uh you know executable because ideas on their on our useless ride. It's all about executing successfully. Yeah, I love the structure and I love the practical like step-by-step templates, practical tools that people can use. So, that's I think that's one of the reasons that I will be recommending the book and I hope people will love it. So, and why why so so the reason why you focused on those companies is that you have been working with them and also I think you need credibility, right? or you I mean you need some kind of foundation about what you're talking about and I think I have worked in across legacy businesses and industries. So I worked with a lot of startups and scaleups in these sectors too like in legacy sectors and so why I think they are important is because um the like there was this kind of period where everyone was excited about oh everything is going to be software etc and software is super important but like I say you cannot eat wear or live in software so we're going to remain in a physical world of atoms and while you know it's great to understand digital and datadriven value creation paradigms it's super important not to diss or or forget that we're living in the physical world and that physical businesses are super critical to our lives to our societies to our economies and I there is just so much amazing content for SAS for startups for a lot of sort of you know digital first digital native businesses and what I felt was there was something missing for legacy businesses right for non-software native businesses and and that's why I wrote this book because I you know I I felt I didn't have a lot to add to the already ex uh you know existing amazing content and and so that's the reason why I wrote this book and to your other question about is it only for legacy businesses in fact got some really good positive feedback from a lot of people across the board and in fact one of my early reviews I got a fivestar review for a book award and you know as part of a submission to a book award and what they said was this is in its broadest sense it's a book about how to make smarter decisions and from that point of view it's uh you know if you were to generalize the idea it's actually a business self-help book in the sense of it applies to really everyday situations for anyone but of course when you write a book you know you know this from your amazing work with product compass and what you're doing which is that you need a clear ICP you need clear focus if you want to deliver value and so for me that focus is legacy business owners yeah I understand so it's like also positioning but also part of your credibility but as a person who who have been working like more than 15 years in software engineering. I think that's almost every piece of advice from the book can be applied to software as well. So, I'm really happy to hear that. That means a lot coming from you. Could you give us a short summary of the framework? So, let's go through the steps. I think the framework has six core steps, right? The steps are save, leverage, align, simplify, optimize, and grow. Right? And the first step is save and save is all about avoiding costly group think mistakes right and that lead that lead to low impact. The next step leverage is you know once you've saved money by not doing you know in the broadest sense stupid things right now you can invest that money on the few things that bring very high impact right and that's what leverage is about. It's about identifying your unique unfair advantage, right? And then counterpositioning based on that and leveraging it to drive value creation. Then once you've identified, right, this high leverage opportunities and there aren't a hundred of, you know, they're not hundreds of them, right? So you need to find it's not so much about doing a lot, it's about doing the few right things, identifying them and doing them. And to do them successfully, you need alignment. Meaning you need everyone and everything to be aligned to those few leveraged opportunities, right? That's the only way you can execute successfully. And once you've aligned everyone and everything to those highly leveraged opportunities, now you can think in terms of simplification. And why simplification is super important because very often when we think about about creating value, we think about doing more and we think of adding things. The important thing is when you're problem solving, when you're doing stuff, by every time you add something, you're increasing the complexity of the overall system. And so unless you actively have a principle that kind of forces you to simplify you, complexity will grow out of control and that will lead to eventual collapse. And once you've simplified, right? So now where do we stand? We have saved by, you know, cutting out a lot of wastage. We have focused on the highly leveraged stuff. We've identified it. We've aligned everyone to that. We have simplified the rest. And now you're ready to optimize because unless you optimize you will not get the maximum return out of what you've set up so far. And once you've optimized now you're ready to grow. And what do we mean by optimize? So by optimize I mean like um once you have a setup um right that leverages a unique strength that everyone's aligned to and that you've removed all the clutter now you need to push the boundary beyond just what is good enough right and so I have this notion of of uh satisficing uh which is a you know a combination of of of uh sat of satisfy and suffice and what happens very often is when you have a few, you know, when you start winning, you very quickly then say, you know, it's okay, you know, we're already got some wins, you know, why should we push harder, right? And it's exactly at that point that you want to say, great, we need to max out our potential because if you don't, right, the risk is that someone who has done the same thing, so someone who has found their own leverage, who has aligned everything and everyone to that leverage, who is simplified, if they optimize and you don't, they will grow faster. And so it's almost like logically unless you optimize you're not making full use of of the opportunity in front of you. And then of course all of this is to grow, right? I mean the whole point of this is to grow. And so that kind of wraps up, you know, brings together this framework. Yeah. Make perfect sense. And when and I'm listening to it if I didn't know that this is about legacy companies like like maybe examples in the book some of the examples are about legacy companies but safe waste reduction. This is for me this is for example product discovery that every product manager does when working on a product and by performing experiments leverage is about focusing on what you are good at your data your team your competencies like having a funer market fit maybe or just leveraging your existing resources not trying to do something completely different aligning for me is about strategy so in strategy it's so first you need to formulate strategy and not every company has it another thing is that you need to define not only what you do and what you focus on but also what you don't want to do. So your trade-offs and make sure that everyone understands them and then align on the objectives so that teams can work together and work toward the same goal or goals that are just a few things the most important for the organization and optimize uh optimize like in product management we do this continuous discovery but also we continuously test our ideas with the customers where we got real feedback also market environment changes technology changes so we need to iterate and refine I mean our products but also our strategies if that makes sense. No, totally. I think and grow is just grow. So that's the ultimate goal. Yeah. No, for sure. I think I think it it it's Yeah, it very much kind of applies also to product management broadly. But I think what's also important to keep in mind is what kind of product manager and what kind of product. Right. So at a legacy business when you speak about product managers these are usually people who are working on electrical, mechanical, mechatronic etc products. These are not software products right? uh while when you and me speak about product management we mean software products right or at least kind of you know software products with some kind of you know learning algorithm some kind of datadriven algorithm on top right and so I think why I wrote this book is also to highlight the fact that what is good product thinking and product management in the tech sort of you know software product space is different for other technologies so let's take the example of a car right a lot has been made of for example Tesla right where they say oh they develop uh a good software they release it very often etc at the same time you also hear how things are falling off these cars how they crash right how the physical let's say the traditional car part of these cars is not good and similarly the opposite for some of the German cars where they're struggling to to write good software but overall the physical part of the car right the mechanics the engine you know the electronics all of that is rock solid and and good quality and so the notion of how you do good product management for every technology is different especially for physical products versus non-physical products. And then the distinction then like so physical products, digital products and then datadriven products like like a datadriven product structurally you would want to release it as soon as possible because it learns with the user in the loop. So, you know, like a physical product like an aircraft or a car, you would want to test to a point where you only release once it's 99.999 whatever percent sure not to break or explode. A digital product you can launch at let's say around 60 70% of maturity because um you will optimize it with based on user feedback and a datadriven product you would launch even earlier. And so this these are fundamentally different ways of working. And so if you have a company that is trying to operate in these in these three value creation paradigms, if they design the same set of processes, right, the same set of the same way of thinking and operating, they will struggle just like Tesla struggles to make good hardware and the German car company struggle to make good software, right? I think that that's for me the perfect example in industry where you see that where you see the clash of these value creation paradigms and where you see that they are fundamentally different and so that's you cannot really transform anything these are separate paradigms you need to understand these paradigms you need to operate in these paradigms in a way that you can win in each of these paradigms and that you cannot apply the same winning strategy across all of them. Uhhuh. So what are the the differences between the work of product manager who works on a physical product and product manager who works on a software or technology? Yes, I think that there are multiple kind of dimensions along which you can you can look at this. So one is for example development cycles right a physical product structurally has much longer development cycles usually 5 to 10 years depending on how regul regulated the market is right um and so we're looking at aircraft cars industrial equipment all of these things just have multi-year or even a decade long development cycle. If you look at software, you want to be releasing much much much faster, right? And and if you're looking at datadriven products, in fact, the product itself grows through user interaction, right? A datadriven product grows based on data, right? And so you cannot really, at least for software, for example, you want to reach a certain core set of of value delivered before you pull the user in. For a datadriven product, you want to go even sooner. And so you know in that sense the uh product management for these three paradigms is fundamentally different and the book name is data impact. So how do you collect data in those legacy companies? Yeah. So so so actually they you know what I start out by saying is if you're a legacy business you're not a startup right meaning by definition you already have customers you're not trying to acquire customers you already have customers and so you should start there. So for example the leverage step one of the first things is understand your customer demand properly and it sounds very obvious but like most people do not do that rigorously enough right they do not understand the power laws that drive that drive their customer impact and and so when it comes to data there is a lot of data available but the objective is not to try to look for every possible data source and then spend hundreds of thousands or millions on vendor solutions move all the data somewhere there start cleaning it without knowing without knowing what what you're going to really do with it. The important thing is to find your leverage which is usually one or two things that you weave together and that's the only data that matters right it does like just because you have done it somewhere doesn't mean it's creating value right and some example of do you remember a specific situation when the companies was analyzing the data and found something maybe it might be anonymized a bit yeah of course so um so I if you see some of the playbooks I deconstruct in the book right they all focus around companies either that are uh you know decades or or half a century old or a century old all the way down to scaleups in legacy industries that are a decade old and what they're all doing is fundamentally figuring out how data can drive value for their customers right so if we take some of the specific examples in the book there's octopus energy in the UK that is is using supply demand data in real time to bring value to their customers like no other utility has done. Which means that if I'm choosing a utility, you know, in a utility business with something where, you know, they all look the same. In fact, the word utility in common parlance has come to mean things that are all, you know, almost equivalent, right? And so what happens with what Octopus is doing is that the value they're creating and delivering to their customers is so unique that you don't really compare them with any other energy provider because you know exactly how they stand out and what value they bring because they're letting you optimize your consumption to the real-time energy price. If we take another example as a German mutual insurer that completely dominates the motor vehicle insurance market in Germany but despite being regional despite being a mutual insurer they're not listed company right and what they've done is fundamentally understood the value they deliver to their customers along you know three core values which is they're entirely digital right again sounds very obvious but most of German insurers don't even have email addresses for all their customers so they're completely digital they have an extreme extremely simple user experience online. So insurance per se is a very complex product right and complex industry. What they have done is radically simplified it for the user and they are from a from a price perspective super competitive because what they're saying is we will keep things as simple as streamlined as obvious to use as possible for you. And in doing that all the savings we're going to uh factor them in to offer you the best you know price policy on the market. And so there are many examples of how of of how all kinds of different companies across sectors have done this. But what they what I'm trying to get at is they're not saying oh let's collect HR data let's collect some you know other random external data and let's create fancy dashboards. Right? That's not what solved the problem. The the point is they're focused on the value they're delivering to their customer in the datadriven paradigm and they have obsessed about that value creation process based on data and then they just ignore all the rest. Right? You don't want to do a hundred different things at the same time. Yeah, that's those examples are quite unique to legacy products and legacy companies. Especially the first one is like how you deliver. It's not about modifying the product or something that needs to take a lot of time but rather analyzing the data from value delivery and optimizing the delivery right but that's also part of the value proposition there's another example you know from so I have I have one example from from India also you know it's like I have a lot of examples from the Europe and the US and I wanted to include an example from an emerging economy and there's Bajage Finance which is a familyowned business and they completely dominate the the the kind of personal credit consumer credit market. I think they mean estimates are they have about 60 70% market share and the way they do that is um they're they're able to uh compute credit risk for every individual customer right on site. So they they leverage their legacy brand, they leverage the partnerships they have with physical stores so that when you go to buy something, you test uh you know you buy a consumer product, let's say a washing machine and or something more expensive, whatever, right? You you check it out, you look at multiple brands and products in a store room in in a showroom, sorry, and then you walk out with your washing machine and when you go for checkout, there is one of their people waiting there. they make you an an offer on spot and you get full financing for it. And so this is a like this is where they're leveraging their their trusted brand where they're leveraging their access to physical points of sale, right? Because that this is unique in the sense of you're not doing a digital only checkout. You're also there in physical stores in large physical stores with direct partnerships and of course you have self-s served components. So now increasingly I think about half of their new loan generation is is app based or is happening online right self-s serve but but this is one more example yeah great uh you mentioned started ret mentioned started with customer value why is this important because isn't that the whole point of the whole point of a business right like it's about the customer as you know as Peter Ducker said right it's all about the customer right and and it's about delivering value to the customer and I think that unfortunately gets lost in all the tech talk and all the AI buzz and all the other stuff is you forget that it's not about cutting open a you know small process on the supply side it's not about a specific system or you know a new vendor solution or some other consultant uh MVP uh that sounds cool right this is about the customer fundamentally only a few things that really create value for the customer I think if you think um across like you know what will still what will still be meaningful and valuable for the customer you know in a decade or more and it's something that's attributed a lot to Jeff Bezos right when he says everyone asks me what's going to change in the next 10 years no one asks me what will not change right and if you want to build a successful business you have to focus on what will not change and similarly if you have a data you know if you want to create value in the datadriven paradigm you have to ask yourself how is data a core driver of value creation for things that will not change over the next decade because that's what your customer you know that's what is really going to bring value to your customer and that is what will compound over a decade you know and the magic of compounding I think is every investor understands yeah and I agree that customer value this is the the whole point of the business or building products but it's not always obvious because many companies focus on those revenue metrics or trial or acquisition without really thinking much about satisfying customers and what I like about your framework is that in grow there is this u I read this comment about building sustainable growth so not just like short-term boost in in revenue but uh sustaining and for me sustainable growth is um it it always results from sustainable sustainable value creation for customers you cannot trick that yeah no totally and I think the important word is really value creation when I say like you know I wrote this book for operators who think like investors, right? At the end of the day, you putting in some effort and you trying to get as much value out for your customer as possible. And if you do that successfully, right? Uh if you make these highly leveraged, asymmetric, aligned, simplified, optimized bets, then you will grow. Great. Interesting opinions from the book. So the first one is the danger of group think where everyone agrees too easily. What's challenging about the group thinking and uh why is it the problem and how can we avoid that? Yeah sure. So I think the thing with group think is if you what happens very often especially in legacy sectors is you have this notion of you know sort of quote unquote best practices right or conventional wisdom that is just kind of followed and the reason for that is legacy businesses are non-software native born in the industrial age and if you think of the industrial age you know it's about 300 let's say 250 300 years old and the whole point was supply right meaning until the end of the second World War across most of most of the planet we were supply constraint right that's why you had had mass migrations during colonization that's why you had a lot of trade around the world where people were trying to move physical products around you know the shortage of initially you know things like spices and silk and all of that right I mean that's kind of you know the old movement of goods that was those were the super valued stuff pearls and all of that and then you move into raw raw material for the industrial age like oil and steel etc. And what happens and and other minerals and what happens there is you were trying to like every time you optimize supply a little bit given that your uh you know given that your your physical product is made up of raw materials and labor. If you can optimize something in the production process your profits increase significantly. So that's that's how value creation works in the industrial paradigm. And so you know labor unit labor and raw materials and improving the supply side is what brings you more value right because once you produced it if you produce it the cheapest possible right so let's say you're making yeah let's say making you know coffee mugs right almost every like at the end of the day that it's not like every coffee mug is not that different right so then it's pretty commodity right so in that sense you want to make it as cheap as possible and if you make it as cheap as possible you will make more money right the moment you move. What's fundamentally happening here is that you have constant costs of replication, right? So once you've set up your factory and all of that, from then on you have constant costs of replication and constant costs of personalization, right? So if you want to write someone's name on every cup, that's going to cost you the same. Let's move to the digital paradigm. And now what happens is your replication costs essentially go to zero, right? You write software once. If I have an the ebook I gave you access to I read it once I can give access to as many people as I want. Um so if we take the you know if we take books right so like this paperback costs you know this paperback costs a certain amount because you know it's made of all this paper that costs money and every paperback will cost about the same right but the Kindle version is much cheaper because I need to set it up once and then there are no you know there are no logistics costs nothing is being sent around physically and there's no new paper needed right and so the replication costs have gone essentially to zero the personalization costs remain meaning if I try to write an extra you know personalized chapter for every reader I can't really do that it's going to take time every a unit of my time if we move into the datadriven value creation paradigm and we look at the same book we went from paperback to ebook to now let's say an LLM trained on everything I said on my book on all the other books that have inspired it right on blogs on whatever And now suddenly I can say you know for for half the price of the ebook you also get personalization right because now uh you know you you can ask one deep question and I will generate one personalized chapter to your question right um and and and that is what has fundamentally changed and so it's not about supply anymore right what's happening increasingly is that supply is becoming almost free right because replication's gone to zero personalization is gone to zero so it's all about demand and and that's a fundament fundamental shift. And so if you continue to be supply constrainted, if you continue to be in that scarcity mindset of I can only think of value creation based on the amount of raw material I have, then you're missing out on the massive opportunity for growth, right? Because with like I you know like I just showed with this physical paperback, let's say it's 222 pages, right? In terms of thickness. So now if I have n if I have pages, right? And let's say n is 2 million. Then I divide that by 222. It tells me exactly how many books I can produce. When I when I the moment I have an ebook in the digital paradigm, it's irrelevant how much paper I have, right? It does not matter how much paper I have. If I have 2 million pages, I can still sell some paperbacks, but I can offer the the ebook to as many people as I want. And again, in the now we move into the datadriven digital paradigm, right? And I train a one LLM on this, right? or any other model. Let's say I could even build like a whole pipeline of you know of various uh kind of nuggets of value that I offer. That's that has a one-time setup cost and very almost zero personalization costs from then on. Uh and so it's no longer about it's no longer about raw materials. It's no longer about effort about time that I put in. It's all about am I bringing value to the person who is interested in this? But how this uh can can uh companies that create physical products leverage this because this is another topic that I wanted to ask you about scarcity mindset versus abundance mindset. So can we apply this to also to physical products or only when the company has this digital part. Yeah. So you can't I mean just logically you can't like so so the physical product forces you to think in terms of supply constraints because you need raw materials right to produce something physical. So for the physical product itself you are supply constraint but what I'm saying is if you want like if you are a legacy business with a physical product do not constrain your investments in digital and datadriven products based on these physical constraints. Let's take the example of airlines today. If you think about the core value proposition of airlines that how they started, right? It was about moving people from point A to point B. I get on a plane in city A, they fly me to city B, that's it. And then I pay them, I buy my ticket and that and and that was it. And that itself was very hard. Initially, aviation wasn't, you know, a century ago. It was just getting started. It wasn't very safe. Over time, you know, the the sector has matured. uh the supply side of aviation is extremely safe, global and cheap, right? And compare, you know, just just compare the experience of flying in the early is with today, right? It's just uh you know, 30 35 years later, it's just you feel like you're taking a flying bus today, right? You don't have that sense of premium anymore just because it's so commoditized. And so now you ask yourself the question, if you think from a supply constraint perspective as an airline, it's all about how many planes do I have? How many passengers can I fly from point A to point B? Right? How do I optimize that? Can I squeeze in more seats in economy or whatever, right? That that's the thinking. It's all about supply. Now, think about how airlines are really making money today. If you look at the traditional airline business, right, of of flying people around, that business is operating at, you know, at at at kind of razor thin profit margins, right? Most airlines are making singledigit profits if at best, right? Um you know a lot of airlines are not even profitable and many are lossmaking as far as the traditional business is concerned. But where does the true value enterprise value of an airline lie in its loyalty program today? So the airlines loyalty program is where the airline is turning its loyal customer base essentially into a bank. Right? So every time you fly you get miles. The airline sells those miles to a whole bunch of other partner companies. Right? very often financial services but also others and that allows the airline now irrespective of how many aircraft they have to create value for you as the customer right they're not forcing you to fly them right but they're giving you something in exchange that makes you fly them and I've observed this myself right very often you might have a ticket that's cheaper from another airline but you really want those miles right because oh next time you get an upgrade to business or you get lounge access right or you collect those miles on your credit card and with that you and buys, you know, you can buy something for cheaper for Christmas, right? Or you get an extra insurance, travel insurance on top. And so what happens here is the core airline business of physical aircraft of optimizing optimizing routes and supply and moving people around is irrelevant. It's all about demand and it's about creating value for the customers you acquired originally through your airline operations but giving them more value by through partnerships right with banks with insurers with taxi companies or you know whatever like the last mile commute for example from the airport to your home with lounge access right with other airport services. So, so it's a combination of your core business in the industrial paradigm, a whole bunch of new services weaving all that together in a datadriven way. This can only be done data driven, right? So, in a sense, they are leveraging the data that they have to, right? Because they offer Exactly. The customer like so the the customer demand in a datadriven way. They're creating value for their customers independent of how many aircraft they have, right? How big their fleet is. Mhm. Yeah. I like this example. So in this new paradigm we should focus on looking for a solution and how we can leverage what we have and partner for the rest. You know, you don't have to have every you don't you don't have to uh have the supply for everything. You can partner with others who do that. You know, banks are also legacy businesses. Insurancees are is also legacy. And so you have airlines who are legacy partnering with banks who are legacy. Partnering with insurance, that's legacy. Partnering with airports, you know, partnering with um you know, with taxi, you know, premium limo services, whatever. And so it shows that at the end of of the day it's about delighting your customer and it's delighting your customer in a very personalized datadriven way. Yeah, great example. Uh thank you for that. Any other surprising ideas that came up besides group think and abundance that came up when writing data impact or maybe something that you can leverage not only at work but on a personal level. Yeah, for sure. I think there's something something pretty useful that I think product managers can apply directly and I'll take two kind of concepts and build them into something useful together that's super relevant for product management and they're both kind of you know military inspired and so one and and and you know you can also say you can also legitimately ask you know why military and not just because I'm interested in military history because it's because the military is for me as an organization the only one that has the highest stakes because a mistake kind of results in death and because they operate at a scale that almost no business in the world can operate at. And so I love kind of getting inspired by examples on how to achieve outcomes because it kind it's kind of the most extreme operating environment. And let me weave together through two things. Sorry, but I I just just because I just comment what you said. So it's not that uncommon. So for example, there is a great book extreme ownership that is about leadership and uh and leading others that is also written based on military experience. So I perfectly get that. No, I'm I'm glad because it's yeah I don't want to come across as some kind of you know wararmongering author or something but I think I think it's about understanding certain principles that just that just work and scale really well in high stake situations. And so one one idea I think that that is super useful as a product manager is through the idea of commander's intent right which is when you're thinking uh when you're thinking through what you want to solve and how you want to have your team work on executing it successfully yes you can follow a whole bunch of of rituals and practices and you know it can be all the different flavors of agile or you know whatever but very often what happens is these all become rituals right it's like oh we have to do this meeting now and we have to do another meeting now and we have to write our PRD and we have to write something else here. We have to write something else there. The important thing is that to execute successfully you need to focus on a few things that that will ensure successful execution and those are usually you know those are made up of like a clear goal and I think sounds very obvious but very often the clear goal is not stated properly and not in a simple way in the sense that not everyone understands it right an end state which should clearly define your ideal outcome a sequence of sort of highle level phases or steps to get there, right? And what resources and teams need to come together an initial state, right? To say look, this is where we stand today. This is where we're starting, right? Key decisions. Uh so you you don't kind of every decision is not the same, right? There are certain key decisions and you want to highlight them right at the outset. Anti- goals, I think, is super important because very often what happens is you only describe the goals, but you don't describe the anti- goals. And the anti- goals are actually red lines that clearly tell everyone what to avoid and what you don't want. And because what happen very often is people are enthusiastic to do something and they end up doing something with the right intentions that that brings you into a spot you don't want to be and constraints right understanding constraints is super important and making sure everyone has understood these constraints. I'll just share a little um a little interesting story I found while researching the book. So apparently Napoleon had had an old illiterate staff uh you know um foot soldier in his general staff. And the reason why he he kept this person on his general staff is every time there was a written order drafted to be sent out to the units, it would be read out to this illiterate foot, you know, old foot soldier because he's illiterate. He can't read, right? Which means, if you think about it, right, a typical unit would have the commander read out the orders. So that's exactly how every soldier is going to hear the orders on the battlefield, right? They're not going to read it themselves. So it's going to be read out to them, which means when it's read out, it needs to be clear. And so they would read out the orders to this soldier in the general staff, and he was supposed to explain the battle plan, the orders back to Napoleon. And if his interpretation of the orders was not at the level of clarity that Napoleon wanted, it would be rewritten until it reached that level of clarity. And this is this is something that if we if you can get a whole bunch of units on a battlefield to coordinate to achieve something and this level of quality in communication helps you achieve that. It shouldn't be that hard, you know, to get your engineering, product, and marketing teams to align. So I think raise the bar of alignment and communication and you will get better results, significantly better results. And so combining this idea of commander intent with another super important concept which is the idea of relative superiority. And what happens very often is as product managers we do two things. One is we try to define our goals and do a whole bunch of rituals and and follow certain practices and processes to achieve those goals. And what happens very often is the intent get lo get gets lost in the way. And the other thing is that we love making road maps right. So we draw these bar charts. This will take this much time etc. And time is time is a very arbit if you think about it like in a very abstract sense like time is the is a very arbitrary axis on which to plot things. Yes some kind of the finance person might want to plot something on time right but from a product craftsmanship perspective time is irrelevant right? what matters more is certain critical points along the journey, the mission you're on. Right? And this idea of relative superiority was actually in the master thesis of of the um of uh of the person who led the raid that resulted in Osama bin Laden being shot. And you know this was written by analyzing a whole bunch of special operations uh in the 20th century to see what you know what common pattern exists across them because if you think about it a special operation by definition it has the word special which means each of you know each operation is unique but but the idea was to say hey there must be something right that's common across them. So this was this was the you know this was the master thesis of Admiral uh William McCraven. He has a very good uh YouTube commencement speech. I think that was very popular where he spoke about some other set of values I think that are very good life lessons. But what Admiral William McCraven then said is if we if we look at a mission you know achieving a certain objective once that intent has been communicated you want to mark out the critical phases where you achieve relative superiority. And what that means is these are phases where there is a certain notion of risk and when you cross that right it's your inflection point you cross that there is a certain part of the mission of your product development that is derisked. So if we take let's say a hostage situation you know where there are terrorists that have hijacked an aircraft right so the point of relative superiority can be once all the attackers have been neutralized the mission is not over yet right but the key risk of a hostage dying is now essentially zero and so you want to think of your product development in terms of these key uh milestones of relative superiority and not in terms of time because if it takes a few units of time more or less that does not really matter. The point is are you going from one risk inflection point to the next. Okay. Yeah, that made me thinking right now about how we define goals for product teams and we often talk about the current goal and the like long-term vision. But what you describe with Aavan is like defining the the goal but also some intermediate goals that matters like checkpoints and giving this broader perspective to the team that is going to work on it or execute the plan as I understand this is not about specifying every single step that the team so this is the commander intent but also put putting some constraints and things that we don't want to do and uh perhaps making some decisions that guide what the team will will be doing to succeed. Yes, exactly. It's it's very interesting but like the more you communicate intent instead of just telling them what to do. So instead of saying do ABC D right you think the more you break down tasks right the better or the more you can decentralize it's actually the exact opposite right which is the more you clearly communicate intent the better every team can execute and every person can execute on it so do not focus in breaking stuff down you know into small little execution packets because the environment is fast that's that's why I also like special operations because it's an unpredictable fastchanging highstakes environment, right? And most of the kind of things we're doing today are similar to that, right? Because things are changing very fast. You don't fully know your environment. You don't really fully understand your customer, right? At any point in time, you keep learning about what's going on. And so, you want that adaptability. And so, the moment you try to break something down into, I don't know, a set of fixed user stories, you've already killed uh impact. And and that's so common, right? And especially in legacy businesses, it's such an industrial way to think. I mean, you know, you're not you're not manufacturing a car, right? You're delighting a customer. That's a I mean, in the datadriven digital paradigm, that's a very different kind like you're not producing a product uh that is is supply driven physical product. It's cannot be speced out like that. And so, you want to communicate intent. You want to understand and have alignment around what are the key inflection points, right? You want to encapsulate the risk in phases and then you want to exe execute in a decentralized but coordinated way. So it's it's aligned with software and the technological products very well. Like I've been recommending that book no rules rules where Restings and Aaron Meyer they talk about living with yeah Netflix living with context no control. explaining not only what needs to be done but more focusing on on the strategic intent and all the context information strategy business model so that people can decide. Some new element that I started thinking about after reading the book and other discussion is keeping some balance about between those only specifying the problems and how the success will be measured. But in practice also you want often to make some decisions and create a draft of or main phases of the of the solution. Does it make sense? Yeah. So it's not like p pure this is the problem and now some coordinate like you need to so the the key goals the vision the key intent has to be centralized right you cannot crowdsource intent. I think this something you also see very often is in legacy companies you know they bring together the I don't know the entire function or an entire org and they say oh we will crowdsource AI use cases right so we're going to basically get everyone in it feels very nice it feels you know sort of pseudo democratic it feels like very inclusive but it's all nonsense right because if you think about the wisdom of the crowds right the kind of mathematical foundation that says the wisdom of the crowds leads to better decision is convers jury theorem right and there's certain assumptions there which is that everyone has the same ideally the same if not at least very similar context so if you look at you know law kind of legal trial movie you know movies or or TV series from the US right where they have a jury system you see all the jurors are are are seated at the same time through the entire trial every time evidence is presented so that everyone has the same context because otherwise this thing doesn't make sense. You want the same incentives, right? So, this is again like why you can't crowdsource something is because every team has different incentives, has different goals, right? Has different metrics they want to hit. And so, and very often they're in conflict, right? So, if you take just the typical tension between sales and marketing, right? Or sales and product. Sales always wants to push the price down, right? Because, hey, the cheaper I am, the easier for me to sell and hit my revenue target, right? Of course, product and pricing is thinking about it differently. Marketing is thinking about differently. And so you clearly see that if you have conflicting interests, you can't crowdsource a a winning strategy from that. And you need decisions to be independent, right? Which is the other thing which the moment you put 10 people in a room, they'll all look left and right and try to say the thing that everyone else will agree to or will make them look smart. And very often what makes you look smart is if you just nod to the important person in the room, right? But that does not lead to the best decision. If we if we apply the same method of decision-m to trading, right, it would be as if we called our entire team in and we asked them we crowdsource the idea of which stock to buy. If you started investing like that, you would very quickly lose all your money. Uh I as I understand it doesn't mean that we need to ignore what others say or the data that they have or customer conversations like it's just only about the centralizing decision making and deciding on strategy and objectives. We still can listen to our teams and listen to what sales is communicating or insights that they bring. Right. Correct. So information collection should be decentralized but strategy definition cannot be decentralized cannot be crowdsourced. Right? Because it's about you need so the people who are deciding something like this need the right kind of need the similar context and the right kind of overview and the right incentives. Right? The incentives cannot be in conflict just logically because if if you have incentives in conflict you cannot come up with a winning strategy because all you'll come up with is a good enough common denominator that everyone feels comfortable with which is not a winning strategy obviously. And the other thing is about leverage which is that if you ask a 100 people for 100 for for ideas you will get a 100 different ideas most likely or at least 80 different ideas uh but you cannot do 80 different things right it's about doing the two or three things right and those two or three things might not even show up in the list of 100 and so I think I think executive I think executive capability and what leadership is about is about thinking through from first principles what are those two or three things that are high leverage and and executing with full alignment you know in a simplified and optimized manner ruthlessly to get those things done because if you don't execute on them it's meaningless but sorry Tavan based on uh your framework what are the common mistakes you see that people make people teams leaders founders make when they try to use data in legacy companies um I think the most common thing is you just try to do you you think that effort is equal to outcomes meaning you try to do too many things. Let's build more dashboards. Let's build more apps. Let's build, you know, let's train more machine learning models. That's not what's going to drive the, you know, that's not what's going to drive the needle. That's not what's going to improve the outcomes. You need to do the few things that matter that drive the outcomes. And that's what leverage is all about, right? Which is like minimum effort for maximum outcomes. The other thing is alignment. I think we've gone through in through different examples. If you don't have alignment, it's not going to work. And alignment is just in fact in fact the framework is just born through things that I've seen not being done properly. Leverage alignment and simplification and optimization is super important. And of course growth, right? Which is at the end of the day it's not about supply, it's about the customer. It's about value delivered to the customer and it's about growing with abundance. Yeah. Like every step in their framework is logical. And I'm repeating like I've been repeating for many years that product managers don't need to work 40 hours a week like 30 or sometimes even less is enough. But what I see that is that many people try to do many things that if they don't do it nothing no one will know in in a month or two like like this making effort for the sake of making effort it's like something glorified and if you just try to find one two three things a day or maybe one really important thing a week that will make a difference you can get much better outcomes. I never understood why why this is happening that people put so many effort in things that don't need to be started but they don't need to be done at all. Nothing will happen if they don't do it. Yeah. Wait, the problem with superior on its own. Yeah, I know. Exactly. And but but there are a few leverage things and I think every moment you spend running after something that's not high impact is a minute you've wasted right in in doing something that's not high leverage. And then so I I introduced this idea of the data impact LNO framework. So the LNO framework was initially coined in the context of software products by Shreas Dshi who writes you know a lot on on product management and I adapted this in data impact to come up with an LNO framework for data impact and Ln O is leverage, L is leverage, N is neutral and O is overhead. And so the way I define these buckets is that overhead is anything you do that has a constant payoff. Doesn't matter how big the payoff is, but it's a one-time payoff. It's a one-time number that that you get out. The neutral is anything that has a that has a constant payoff over time, right? So let's say you tweak a process, it gets 2% better. So you get 2% extra value over time. And a lot of so if you think about a lot of SAS solutions, a lot of vendor solutions that try to optimize something are focused in the on the end bucket. What happens very often is businesses start thinking about their own business in terms of the end bucket, right? The neutral bucket and that's that does not make any sense because you don't have a competitive advantage in the end bucket and if you develop something in in this kind of process improvement bucket then you want to be a SAS provider because you want to provide it to the entire industry and capture that value. It does not make sense for you to try to build something because there is no competitive. You don't have a moat and there is no unique competitive advantage. And what happens the most often though and especially what vendors are incentivized to do is to sell you stuff. Let me do a data rich deep dive of XYZ. That's going to take a lot of time. is going to be a one-time 300page report that no one's going to read. And that's completely useless because let's I don't know let's let's do a forecast for revenues next year, units sold next year. That's completely useless because even if it is valuable at a given point to make one decision, it has no it has kind of growth in value over time. The neutral bucket gets you constant growth over time. The leverage bucket is your unique unfair advantage and it's about the core of the value you deliver to your customers right and if you think from first principle and identify what falls in your L bucket your leverage bucket and you build that that's what's going to unlock growing future cash flows right so just like the O bucket is one is a one-time payoff the neutral bucket has constant payoffs over time. The leverage bucket has these growing cash flows over time. And so if you take these kind of growing cash flows for and project it into into the future and you try to compute a net present value that's a very high number, right? I it's actually even infinite if it it grows very fast over time even on a not infinite but like it's going to be an exponentially big number. So the amount it cost to execute becomes irrelevant. So like this typical way of the way you would do the way you would assess financially physical products that way of thinking does not make sense in the datadriven digital uh paradigm. And so you want to think in terms of this leverage neutral and overhead. You want to ideally completely stop overhead for the neutral stuff. You want to use v use targeted vendor solutions. If nothing is available only then build it. But focus on the two to three leverage solutions that will bring the most value to your customers and hence to you. Bonus question when we think about save. So the first step in the framework are there different types of savings that we can make also like one time saving, zero saving or leverage saving. So yeah, so leverage is about value creation, right? It's not I think the the idea in save is really just stop doing stuff that that does not bring value or the one-time stuff right the overhead stuff like stop trying to write reports stop trying to bring stop trying to build the N plus1 dashboard that no one is going to look at so it's about your work not about your costs. Yeah but you know time is equal to some form of cost in that sense. So stop stop doing nonsense basically right uh stop wasting time and resources on stuff that's not meaningful then leverage gives you a framework to think about what is meaningful right and what is not so then you focus on what is meaningful and save is also about do not think you can consume your way to glory and what I mean by that is you can't just buy an offtheshelf you know technology solution and think it'll fix your problems or that you will suddenly become profitable business that's just not going happen and I have this story in the book uh where um you know someone walks into the room when you know with Charlie Mer and and Warren Buffett and they were Burkshire Haway you know owned textile mills at that point so they were producing you know clothes when this executive walks in and says oh you know there's this amazing new textile mill on the market it 2x's output you know it's like way more efficient this is so you know this is great for us we should buy it and uh Warren Buffett's reaction is hold on. If this is true, we might exit the textile business. And the fundamental insight here is and you go run to any executive or any board and tell them they have more efficient processes and machines, they will get super excited. The point is this is a bad thing for your for your legacy business because when something like this happen, there are two people who are going to profit a lot. One is the person selling the machines. In our context, it's the people selling you cloud and SAS or whatever else you're trying to use, right? whatever software solution I have to use. I mean just look at your bills like I heard this from uh you know from a startup even like their uh their operating costs of 40% license fees and and infrastructure costs like so this is eating your profits away someone else is making money on this and the other thing Warren Buffett said is so the person uh who is selling the machine makes a lot of money and the customer eventually benefits because now the barrier to entry has dropped right because now someone else can buy those machines and can manufacture cheaper and so there's going to be a price competition that should logically eventually push down the prices and so new supply side technology right so the end bucket kind of stuff is going to result in your profit margins being squeezed in your value proposition being diluted unless you very actively think about why you exist and what value you deliver to your customers and you up your game through thinking about leverage and leverage is your unique unfair advantage and the last thing the last two things I wanted to ask you about thank thank you for that is uh in thinking about data impact so should all our decisions be informed by the data driven by the data or maybe there is some space for intuition or experience what's your opinion yeah know that's a very good question in fact the way I like to think about this is really if you want to scale datadriven value creation you need to identify the the routine stuff right so the 70 80% of volume that drives most of the value that is relatively stable that is high you know that is high high frequency that is high velocity etc. So all the stuff that is hard for humans to decide right we so what you need to understand is the human mind has a certain like has a limited memory and has a limited capability for handling information. So anything that's high volume, that's relatively predictable, that that's fast moving, that's high frequency, etc. That's the stuff you want to systematize, right? That's the stuff you want datadriven algorithms to decide on. And what I mean is not just some kind of black box, but you want to build systems around it to manage risk, to manage edge cases, etc. So there's a whole bunch of um rigorous um systematic decision- making that you can build out, right? There is always going to be 10 20 30% you know it depends on the context but there's always going to be a bunch of things that cannot be systematized you should spend time on that right you should spend time on scoping on understanding on analyzing that and ideally you know over time try to systematize it that's the value of human intellect because if you think now as algorithms and machines get better and better at certain types of tasks we as humans are now forced to confront the fact that we're not the only form of, you know, in the broadest sense, we're not the only form of intelligence on this planet. We need to focus on what makes us unique, right? We need to focus on our leverage, basically, right? So don't don't do a machine's job is what I'm trying to say here, right? Like focus on the super rigorous analytical stuff or the very kind of intuitive creative stuff. That's the stuff that algorithms today are struggling at. And I think the the barrier will change. Certain things that we think are creative today might be done by algorithms over time. But then you know so the bar is rising right but there's always a whole bunch of stuff that we as humans are uniquely positioned to do. So just focus and do those well right machine do the rest. what we'll be better at in 10 years 10 years we as humans or I think if we if we if we take this seriously and and and and and kind of try to get better we will I think as a species we have the opportunity here to get more rigorous in our thinking right more analytical but also more creative and more intuitive in our thinking and I think these are both things that that make us unique right that make us different from machines that make us capable of doing things that machines struggle with and if we do that if we play to our strengths to our leverage right I think then humans with machines together will create a lot more value than we're able to create now that's the goal to deliver more value okay thank you I don't have any other questions that was really insightful we discussed digital transformation and why we do not want to transform the slack of framework group thinking abundance helpful frameworks and how to make data impact And thank you also for being with with us today and for sharing your knowledge and passion. And there is a promotion on Kindle on launch day which is 29th April. So for 99 cents your book correct. Okay. So I highly recommend it. Uh that's uh a must have position and I have read a lot of product management books as you can see in the background. That's probably one of the best in my opinion. And this is I know that this it is positioned as a book about legacy businesses but I'm sure that every product manager every founder also in other areas will benefit from it. It is extremely well structured. It refers to many first principles that people can apply. So yeah, highly recommend it. Thank you so much P. It means a lot coming from you and I just want to say uh thank you for the work you do. who have been I've been subscribed to the product compass and I really enjoyed um each one of your emails and I think it's really valuable the way you you make resources available to product managers. I've learned a lot and uh yeah more power to you. Keep doing what you do. Thank you. Okay. So, thank you once again and I hope we can see we can talk after your book. Yeah. Thanks. You became a bestseller. [Music]
