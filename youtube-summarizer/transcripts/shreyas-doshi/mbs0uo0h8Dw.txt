So it took almost a year actually. Trees, maybe you can tell this part of the story from your end. I remember pinging you over DM. You were very responsive. We had good conversations over DM, but it took a while for you to actually decide to teach. I'm curious for you to share a little bit about that process for you. >> Yeah, for sure. Thank you, Gagan, and the Maven team for having me here. I'm thrilled to be here. This is something I have wanted to do for a while and so I'm also thrilled to see so many folks here. So I get to talk about a topic that I don't normally get to talk about which is just teaching which is something I really love. So let's see. So yes, I think it was about a year that we were chatting before I decided to teach a course. Frankly, I was not sure if I wanted to teach on Maven or if I wanted to teach at the time I began teaching. At the same time, I knew that at some point in my life I am going to teach. I knew that when I was a teenager. At the time I was studying French in 10, ninth and tth grade and I thought I'm going to teach French when I get older and was really passionate about seriously passionate about it because I loved French. I was good at it and of course then I ended up studying engineering and forgot all my French and so now I remember five words. So both things are true. one I knew that I was going to teach in some way very early in my life and at the same time gagan when we started talking I had no intentions of teaching and but I wanted to learn more I wanted to learn more I was doing mostly advising then I had just left stripe and started this new chapter of my career where I was and I continue to advise founders that's actually the main thing I do other than teaching and so I was quite focused on it And I think we had a number of chats. At some point I said, well, it would it would only make sense for me to teach if my cross certain numbers in terms of number of students and whatnot. And I appreciate you back in the day for underpromising. You were like, "No, no, no. That's too much. I don't think you're going to get that in the first year." And I was like, "Well, but I think I need to be able to get that many students." Why? Not because just the vanity number. Maybe there is some aspect of that. But the main thing was I was looking at teaching as a way to scale my advising work because as I was advising what I found is that at some point I had to refuse advising engagements because my policy is not to fill up my calendar with just backto-back advising calls with founders. So that's sort of how I felt okay teaching could be a great outlet for me to be able to reach people that I cannot advise or coach in one way or another. So that's how it started and then I think there was a point at which I felt pretty sure that okay now I'm going to do this. That was about a year in and then this is the fall of 2022 and once I decided to do it I think I did something that I was a nervous wreck for the 8 weeks after I made that decision or it was 6 weeks after I made the decision which is that oh I am going to teach my first course on Maven on the Maven platform in October of 2022 and I decided that in early September of 2022 And I had zero course material. And so that is why the next 8 day 8 weeks 7 8 weeks were extremely stressful for me because I had already opened up a cohort more than 100 people had signed up. And so now I was on the hook to deliver something at the end of October to more than 100 people and I don't have a single slide and I'm still going through the Maven instructor boot camp at the time learning from various folks who worked at Maven on how to deliver a course. So now it's been 3 years. It was definitely a fun experience. I still remember the stress I went through the first those seven 8 weeks when I had to build out the material. But it was an amazing experience and then I've continued since then. Yeah, it was a it was a crazy time especially because I well one thing I really remember actually yesterday I was going through I'm adding I'm going out of town for a little bit and I was adding pin codes on my on my locking system at my house and I remember one of the nervousness nervous things you had was you wanted a backup house to go to in case you your internet went out which I'm going to say now and hopefully you're okay with this but I've never ever ever had that request. We happen to live not too far from each other, but we didn't know each other. We had never met in person at this point, by the way. So, or we had met once in person, so we weren't close friends and you could just come over. But I had set it all up. And I think that's just an example for everyone to remember that. And obviously, he never needed my house and it was kind of a it was just kind of an output of his stress more than anything else. Just trying to make sure anything that could go wrong he had thought through and figured out. And I think it's useful for anyone here because launching your first course can be stressful. It does feel like you're putting yourself out there and it's tough. One thing Shreas that I really am impressed by though is that you responded to that stress by doing more and delivering more. And sometimes people they put out a course and they don't get the traction or they don't get they don't get all the signals they're looking for. And I'd love to hear from you how you think about that first eight weeks and whether or not you were doing things to ensure that you didn't take the stress in a negative way and rather channeled it into what was an amazing first cohort. >> Yes. I almost forgot about that that time when I stopped by your house to figure out the back door entry where you had some code and some key lock box or something. But yes indeed even to this day I have three backup internets. I have once due to so where I live there sometimes there's fires. I mean not where I live but in the state. And so sometimes preemptively they'll turn off power on my street. And so I've had once a case where I had to teach my PM career management course managing your PM career from my cousin's house. And so now the setup I have and this was not a setup I had before. I have total of three internet access options within my house from where I usually teach. I have a viwork I can get to in about 15 20 minutes. I have a whole playlist that my team will play. They they've never had to play it fortunately, but there's a whole playlist my team will play when I'm on route to that viwork and I have access 247 to that viwork where I can play, where I can continue and resume my teaching as well as a couple of backup homes around where I live. Yeah. So, now none of this was there on day one. On day one, I just asked Gagan, "Hey, can I drive by your house?" Cuz it was again, it was the fall and we had some power outages that month. Okay. So, and I'll just jump in here. One of the things about Treyas that I think is is amazing is he comes up with, and this is true for a lot of our top instructors, they come up with brilliant insights that are completely different from what anyone else is doing with their course. The flip side is it's important to recognize he is an nofone human being. And not everyone needs backup internet or every anything he says you should take it for your own. One of the things about a course, it's your own course. I just want to clarify that. I might say that more than once, Shreas, because Just interjecting this is a great point. Nothing I say today should be oh shas is saying that I should do it. That is just my general philosophy. It is it is not even restricted to this specific lightning lesson. Even in my teaching I say that anything I say should not be taken as oh shreas is suggesting that I should do this. Right? I'll make observations and some observations are for you to just consider and actually forget and ignore. other observations might be for you to consider and then think for yourself because that's a fundamental aspect of my philosophy is that you need to think for yourself for your situation. So, thank you for clarifying that. >> Yeah. And aside from this funny anecdote, normally you have a rule about sharing on social media and that kind of thing. And I I was wondering there's a lot of people here who are on socials. How do you feel about them posting lessons from this lightning lesson? Yes, please. So, normally I have and and some of you maybe have been in some of my private sessions where I say don't post this on social media, but here in this session, please share whatever it is. Hopefully, there's something that you took away. Please share that and you're welcome to live share that on X or LinkedIn or wherever. You're welcome to blog about it. You're welcome to Yeah, please take anything that resonates and share it with your audience if that resonates. So let's go to the next topic which is how did you decide a topic like you had eight weeks from when you decided you were going to teach the course to when you went like how do you figure out and how would you advise others on figuring out what should be the course topic that's going to resonate? >> Yes I mentioned I had eight weeks to put together the course material but I should also mention simultaneously that the course was already written inside of me. Right? So the eight weeks was not to come up with material from scratch because it was already written within me. It was more about expressing it in slides and what I'm going to say and so on and I never really had a script for a while. So I was just going to create the slides and talk about it. The course was also informed by almost 15 years of helping others on that topic. And so what was the course? The course was titled managing your PM career. And so that was the course I started. It was very specifically targeted to product managers. Number one. Number two, it was not targeted to what most courses in product management are targeted towards, which is aspiring early career PMs. This course was targeted to mid-career to advanced career product managers. And that was also very intentional because that was my experience. And so the course was a result the material that was already written inside of me over more than a decade was a result of having keenly observed a lot of things about PM careers that most people hadn't. But second and more importantly having coached hundreds of PMs on career related topics. So what I decided to then do is share that what was already embedded in me over the years to share it in a course format for mid-career to advanced career PMS. So that's what I decided to do with this course. >> Why that topic Shreas why that versus other topic options? >> Yeah. So that's also interesting. The that was not the course I really wanted to do. The course I really wanted to do is the course I focus on now, which is the product sense course. And again, the product sense course was written inside of me for a while. So I knew that it was going to come out in some format. I I had no idea. I hadn't heard of Maven until Gagan you reached out to me. It must have been 2021 when or 2022 when you reached out. And so I didn't know anything but I knew that there is a course on product sense and product strategy inside of me. So that is the course I actually wanted to teach. But as I started getting serious about it in the summer of 2022, I realized, oh no, I need two more years to put that course together. Okay. So again, it's already within me. But just to express it, I felt it was going to take time. At the same time, I felt I just felt scared and not very confident about whether I would be a an effective instructor, an effective teacher. And I I'd done I've been a TA in grad school. Students would show up when I would give them lectures because I was a very large university. So I would teach some things directly as a TA. So students would show up. That was the only indication that okay at least students are showing up but I was not at all confident about how effective I would be to what degree my style would resonate and I was not at all confident about all the logistics that would be required to make a course work. So what I decided to do is I asked myself as I realized okay the product sense course is going to take 2 years to bring out is there something that I can do much quicker and that's when I realized that oh the managing your PM career I have been doing it anyway I know exactly what needs to happen and that's sort of more it's not as extensive as product sense and I decided to make things harder for myself by saying I'm going to deliver it over just one weekend. So it was a Saturday Sunday course and so because when you deliver it over just week one weekend with five plus hours of teaching on each day now the logistics requirements operations requirements and the bar is much higher but I felt it would be a great way to practice what it's like to teach the course. So that's how we ended up with this. That was never the intention. But managing your PM career started with I can't teach this other course, but I can teach this this course and I can set a deadline for myself and I can learn how to deliver it over a weekend. >> Yeah. I think the lesson here for me is, you know, you you pick something that was the easiest path for you to get started. So, one of the biggest challenges people have is getting started. Just trying one cohort. You picked a two-day cohort, a course that you felt you could teach fairly easily. Obviously, I know it was still a ton of work over those eight weeks, but easily, and one in which there was demand. Can you talk about the demand part? How did you know that people wanted to take managing your PM career and product sense versus other topics you might Why not product strategy? Why not instead of managing your PM career, PM interview, you know, or product requirements document, something around that? Why did you pick these two topics? >> Yeah. So, and this is exactly where the thing I mentioned earlier applies, which is don't take anything I say as specific advice for each person here that oh, you should do this. What I'll describe is how I think about these types of things. So number one, what drives me to teach is I just absolutely love it. I love the actual practice of teaching. And so for me, it had to start from what is something that I'll absolutely love teaching. Right. And so it's more about looking within and identifying what are some ideas, what are some courses, subjects, topics that I am inherently driven to share. Right? So versus the classic approach of what you might learn in business school of okay survey the market analyze where there's demand and then see how you can create an offering and there is nothing wrong with that approach again what I'm saying is what drives me and how I think about these things and so so for me I didn't do any time analysis or any market analysis or any anything whatsoever for either of these topics and nor am I going to do it for future courses. That being said, it's not just going in blind, right? What I found useful was to just introspect and just from my past experience that these are some ideas that are very unique that have never been shared before in public or private forums. So then that's obviously the material that I hope to teach in the course. So if these ideas have I seen people's I think used to use this term eyes light up right back in the day. So, so I have I seen people's eyes light up when I share that with them in an advising conversation with a founder say on the product sense product strategy side or have I seen their eyes light up in a coaching career coaching conversation with a PM leader and to me that is evidence that do I have something that people are going to find useful, applicable, practical in a way that is unique to what I am teaching. In other words, that they would not likely get this idea. They would likely not get this perspective from somewhere else. So that's sort of the thought process that goes into me deciding what to teach and that is more kind of internally driven versus more analytically driven externally driven. >> Yeah, you had a product sense about what to teach. I'm going to break it down a little bit for everyone which is first he picked a topic he felt like he knew really really well and I think where he had real expertise over others product sense and also career advice are two things that Treyas is just like uniquely super talented at and has made really really good decisions so that's the first thing the second thing is there is a demand component that is inherent in this which is Shreas has watched people as he has given them advice and seeing where they gravitate to. What do they want? And that is a critical component of teaching is remembering that there is a there has to be a desire for the knowledge that's highly valued and people are willing to sort of pay for it and that there's depth there. And then the final thing that I'm hearing is that you did this via qualitative rather than just quantitative assessment. And specifically, I think the thing that's unsaid here is you know your customer really well. He's obviously he teaches product sense. He had product sense around his course. But maybe everyone should also recognize that you should be teaching people who you already know have an interaction with. One of the things if you're an instructor who's never built who doesn't have an audience already and doesn't have an email list, you should be teaching people that come to you for advice already. And ideally, those people who are coming to you for advice or those that extended network is actually your initial seed of your course. So, your first 10 students are all people who are one degree of separation removed from you. Already had an audience a little different. But if you don't have one, that's the ideal scenario. And you send an email to those people and you explain to them what you're going to share. and you see those eyes light up moments and then you you go forward. Okay, this is this has been great. Let's go to the next area which is why did you what made you finally decide to teach? You had a year where you weren't sure. Give us that moment of okay, no, no, I'm doing this. I'm going to do this semif-time. What was the tipping point for you and Yeah. Can we go to that moment? >> Yeah. So really the tipping point was having to refuse advising requests from founders and then realizing okay maybe so I was doing it for a while and so at some point I said okay maybe I should just package some of this up in a more quot scalable format which again would have been the product trends and product strategy course which I now teach. And so then the interesting thing is once that happened, once that sort of okay this is the way and this is the best way to do it. It's funny that inaction and indecision just turned into momentum, right? And so, so now it was about, okay, then the teaching is going to happen, right? The teaching is going to happen. And I went several weeks into the okay how do I structure this product sense course realized that the quality at which I would want this course the again the product sense course to be at for me to feel I'm doing justice to the topic and to my students I realized oh it's two more years right so I almost launched my product sense course the course I teach now and have been for the last one and a half years it took me 3 years of actually creating the material right which I severely underestimated but now that I was there was momentum that's when I mentioned earlier that I said okay why don't I just to get practice teach this other course and by the way that other course I forget but I've taught more than 12 cohorts of that course so it wasn't just a one-time thing because there was strong resonance for that topic as well so I ended up teaching it for a while but yeah that's how it unfolded >> yeah all right Now let's talk about course design. Um you design your courses very meticulously. You've talked about treating them like a product. How do you think about organizing and designing the flow or curriculum of a course? I just first wanted to share that approach and mindset which is essentially think about the course, think about the material, think about how you're going to teach it all of it as a product you're creating. Which then means that we have to understand our user. We have to deeply understand their fears. We have to deeply understand their concerns. We have to deeply understand their hesitations. We have to understand the question that will be in their head when we are presenting this slide. And then what are we going to do with that question? Are we going to address that question immediately in the next slide and give them some closure and relief and relieve that short-term anxiety or are we not? And either case is fine, but everything you do in the course and the way you teach it and how you structure it has to be intentional and it all goes back to understanding the state of mind of your user. >> Yeah. Uh I mean just so everyone understands you know typically the sort of the common advice in course businesses and as you many of you probably know you know I I co-founded Udemy and have been doing some sort of and I my first education business I was actually 13 years old so I've been doing this for a long time and the thing that everyone thinks is they have a marketing problem. The same thing is true for uh products. By the way, if you talk to other entrepreneurs, I've also been an entrepreneur for a while. Entrepreneurs always think they have a marketing problem because they because it's much emotionally easier to blame marketing than it is to blame product. Product is an outgrowth of yourself and your own insights and your own decisions. And marketing is this thing that everyone thinks is bad and annoying. So, it's very easy to say that. But and honestly even at Maven we spend a lot of time teaching people how to do marketing right and we have created whole product lines like our whole launch was of lightning lessons is actually the entire design of lightning lessons is to make it feel like it is a positive thing to do something that people didn't want to do because most instructors were not wanting to market their courses even though it was like they were super excited to teach the course. It's like if you're that excited to teach a course you should be willing to tell people about it. If you're not willing to tell people, you're either something's wrong. Anyway, that's a whole another conversation. But the point here is marketing is what most people blame. But we've actually been surprised over the last couple of years. We have started looking at the data, self-reported data, and also we look a lot of actual analytics. And 30% of all sales and the number one sales driver for any successful course is word of mouth. It is way higher than LinkedIn. Like everyone here probably knows that Maven is huge on LinkedIn, right? We have probably millions and millions of collective followers amongst our instructors. And you would think that people would say LinkedIn as their number one thing and you'd think we're an amazing marketing machine. Actually, I'd say we're an extremely bad marketing machine relative to the other course businesses out there, Udemy, Corsera, etc. What we've done on the flip side is we've delivered incredible value and there's super high word of mouth. And so actually word of mouth is a core part. And actually the person we're talking to on Monday will tell you that she built her entire course without significant marketing and almost entirely off of word of mouth. So it's not just for people who can start with a big boost like Shreas did, but actually through that. And Shreas your numbers are even better than that. You do even more word of mouth than the average person. What do you think drives that? >> Yeah. So that is a metric I obsess over and I do not obsess over many metrics and the way I even identify how good of a job we are doing is very unconventional. The core metric I obsess over is what percentage of people who enrolled for the course heard about first heard about the course from a friend, family member, manager, executive, co-orker. And so we track that and we ask students about it. And for us that it's not always precise as none of these metrics are but we have a way of kind of identifying an actual percentage and it's basically around 35%. So 35% of students have first heard about the course from those sources. One of the other interesting things is the percentage of students saying that they first found out about or heard about the course on the Maven marketplace has been steadily growing up steadily consistently going up and so that's been great to see like when I started in October 2022 is I wasn't measuring this but generally it was probably safe to say it was zero and now it is a meaningful meaningful number. So so that's something we track very closely. The other thing I wanted to call out with this whole marketing point is and Gagan this is something you told me when I wasn't even I hadn't even decided to start a course but one of the things you told me is look we I think I remember you saying we have at the time you had instructors on the platform this is early 2022 who had million plus followers so very large reach and what you said is that what you find is that there is some asmtote you reach even with a large following the percentage of people who are willing to take a course who excited to take a course, pay a meaningful fee to do so is actually very small. And I heard that and I'll be honest, I was like, uh, that doesn't sound right until I actually experienced it myself. So, I don't have a million plus followers, but I have a certain following. And the first couple of cohorts I could fill just by sending out messages, LinkedIn or tweets. And then what happened for this managing your PM career course, we hit a ceiling and then we had to figure out other ways. So at the time it was myself and somebody working part-time with me. So I had to figure out other ways to reach because that as low, right? So let's just say approximately if you have 100k followers, which is a lot, right? I would bet not more than generally not more than 400 people or 200 people will actually sign up for your course ever right at 100k followers unless there are interventions. So it doesn't mean that followers never sign up but just by you using your network is never enough and I realized that after my second or third cohort because the fourth third or fourth cohort we were having a hard time just replicating that approach and the funny thing is the first two cohorts I thought oh this will scale infinitely right I was like yeah I'll keep sending tweets and keep sending LinkedIn messages that my next cohort is up and people will sign up and no it doesn't happen right and then I also O realize that there is always a certain part of your following and it's usually a small number, they'll actually buy anything from you. So even if you produce t-shirts, they will purchase it. But again, it useful to understand that that's actually capped at a very low percentage. And for the rest of the people, while they might love what you produce and they like following you, they are never actually going to buy something for a meaningful course fee particularly. Yeah, that that's really really important. You just you have to remember we saw so many instructors with huge followings that totally flopped. And then now the majority of our million-doll instructors, okay, the majority are people who started with Maven with less than 10,000 followers and did not have existing marketing. And so it really has not proven that has been the main determinant of success. And we're kind of surprised by that. Shreas is interesting because he does both I mean annual but also the same the same number applies to lifetime. So it doesn't the statement I made applies to both. But the point here is that if you have a big following and you have an extremely good course then all of a sudden yeah you can do incredibly well and trus is one of those examples. But even but if you just and by the way that's just a matter of time. It's the time it takes to get to certain milestones is faster if you have something. But again the majority of our seven figure instructors did not have that and so it is really about topic. It matters a lot. The last question I have is about positioning. One of the things that you've done really well and been meticulous about is positioning your course. So that is a form of marketing. People think your landing page as an example like how do you tell people what you're going to get, why they're going to get it, how do you choose what to prioritize, what not to prioritize when explaining the value that you're planning on providing to people in the course itself, >> right? And so the core idea of how we're going to position the course as any instructor needs to start with that again that core understanding of the user, right? And in this case the student who's going to take your course and you might have multiple different types of students. It doesn't have to be just one type, right? It could be different roles, different levels of seniority, whatever the case might be, different industries. So you still want a very deep understanding of the condition of that person, right? The challenges they have, the fears they have, the life challenges they have, the career challenges they have, whatever the case might be, depending on what the topic of the course is. It is really important to have that indepth understanding of your user because then that unceing is there your course positioning sort of writes itself [snorts] and especially for people who are like would be instructors or current instructors as is this group. You are already really great at expressing. You're already really great at communicating once there is that understanding. Once there is that deep understanding. Just to give you an idea and an example of the sort of the effect that I'm trying to have on my target sort of user and in this case my student is this is a just a a post from somebody who took the my recent cohort of my product sense course. It actually ended three days ago and so so I thought like this student described really well the effect that I'm trying to have through my teaching. So now the the question then is okay so how do we have this effect? So just wanted to give you a view of how I positioned the product sense course and it's very obvious since we're talking about like a cohort-based course platform that on this axis of okay is my course going to be passive or interactive I was always going to go for interactive but when I was like trying to create the landing page for the product sense course and like think about marketing for the product sense course and then think about like the details of how I'm going to teach it. I was struggling for the other positioning axies and it took me a couple of weeks to realize that actually while most courses in this domain in product and product sense are processoriented story oriented framework oriented i.e They teach you a process which is do this. they make they give you some reps and they make you go through those reps or they tell you stories like okay look at this company this is what they did etc or here's a set of frameworks right so while most courses uh in this category and most training in this category is in this direction what I want this course to be is skill oriented I want people to actually build the skill of product sense during the course itself okay so so that then informed a lot of things including you know the manner in which I structured the day the prompts I gave them throughout the day during the during the course as well as how I framed it on the course landing page. So on the course page the manner in which I frame it is this is about skill and we are going to learn the skill and we are not going to go through you know lots of processes and playbooks and tactics and frameworks all of those are very legitimate ways of teaching there is again you have to understand when I say these things I'm not criticizing or I'm not saying those are not legitimate ways to teach but what I'm saying is about having clarity on how you are going to teach it right and and once you have that clarity now positioning again the the landing page sort of writes itself now is is it still a decent amount of work to kind of do it right of course it is one other thing I want to share at the detailed amount of work is for my product sense page we have 50 FAQs on that page 50 all right so and it's a little too much in a way right but what we what I'm trying to do, right? What I'm trying to do with each >> Sorry, >> continue. I just made a joke. Just >> Oh. Oh, I see. Okay. I I couldn't hear what you said. Okay. So, what we're trying to do with the 50 FAQs is understand what question somebody might have, right? And address it in as clear a way as we can, right? And most of those 50 FAQs were written up front, meaning they were not written in response to people asking me questions. While that is a very fine legitimate way to kind of build your FAQs, the point is most of these were constructed up front because I kind of went through the details of what objection might somebody have, what hesitation might somebody have and then is there a way I can address it. Now the last thing I'll share is there's commonly accepted marketing mantras is well nobody reads anyway right and people are not going to go so deep into your page all of which is true and to which my policy and my approach is it's okay I'm not trying to get that student it's okay I'm not trying to get the student who is going to quit my page in 2 minutes or in 5 minutes I want the student who is serious about building this skill for whom it is the right time in their life to learn product sense, product strategy at a very advanced level. Right? I want to tailor the page for the serious student, for the student who will look at multiple FAQs and I want the student who knows what they're going to get. Right? So that a lot of that shows up in the positioning choices externally as well. >> There's a few questions in the Q&A. Sh want to start looking at it and I'll follow up. you you picked the questions as we discussed, but I'll double down on what you said. I mean, so just so everyone understands what he's talking about is is simulating what the student experience is going to be like and then at each spa moment trying to design the course experience for that. So for example, for teaching product sense, one might say that the most important thing of teaching product sense of learning the skill of product sense is learning how to dissect other products. let's say as an example. And so he's going to make sure that as part of the course you're not just dissecting products in front of people, but rather you're encouraging them to dissect the project the product because that's the difference between building a skill or giving you a framework. This is how you dissect products. These are the three ways you do it. And depending on the skill or the course you're teaching, you might actually choose the other approach. you might choose. There is a there is actually a significant number of frameworks that if you just apply them in this type of situation might be successful. For example, we have someone who teaches evows. My guess is that the skill of teaching evals is less important than the frameworks. His job in that it's a discrete set of rules that will that you need to learn to be successful at eval. There is a philosophy behind it, but it is more of a set more of a triedand-trude sort of process of things. And so my guess is that there would be a different framework entirely for teaching that than there is a skill of product sense. It's a little bit more of something that has to come naturally from within you and that he's his job is to cultivate. Tres, why don't you pick a a question and I don't know if you have one picked out, but would love to have you answer one of them. >> Yeah, for sure. And unfortunately, we're not going to be able to get to all the questions. So, I apologize in advance, but I'll go through a few. Number one, somebody asked, "What's your team like?" And so, I have an amazing team, Kate and Nicole. I work with Kate and Nicole for setting up the course operations. And we have a whole runbook for the course with a detailed set of tasks that get performed. And so, yeah, I wouldn't be able to do this without Kate and Nicole. And before early on, I did not have a team. I actually sort of like worked with somebody who's working with me part-time on on stuff. And during very early days, I would even ask some Maven team members for advice. And actually, frankly, some of the core things I learned about how I want to do my first few cohorts was all from basically the Maven team helping and advising me. So that's about the team. Second, there's a question here. I intuitively understand why the focus on creating a great course comes first. But do you have any advice on filling the first cohort before I have a chance to create word of mouth? And it's what Gagan said earlier. It's about regardless of whether you have a social media presence or a following, there are people you have worked with, there are people you have helped in the domain that you are [clears throat] now thinking about starting your course in. So, so that group is going to be the first group. And for me also for the PM career course that is what I did for the product sense course too that is what I did. So you have to start there. I mean where else can you start anyway? It's not like you have many other options but what I'm saying is even people who do have the reach they usually I'm not saying all of them but usually they find the closer ties especially if it's a new course versus kind of blasting it to everyone up front. So you do want to find people who have interest, who have passion and who have that immediate learning need. People who are who you are naturally helping in one way or another on this topic. So that's that. What are the three key course design principles you think make the most difference in your course? So I haven't really abstracted the design principles and maybe I should think about that. But I think the key the key design principle for the course itself is understand the mindset of your user number one. So that's the broader thing which is how do they think how do they look at the world what are their hesitations etc etc. So that's one and second try to deeply understand and simulate what feelings what fears what questions they are going to go through as you share this material with them. So pretty much every choice we make for instance one of my and this is not a design principle people would say this is a design principle what I'm about to say it's not but one of the core things about you know my product sense course is I teach for 5 hours on certain days I teach for 5 hours I give one break or two breaks of 3 minutes each that's it right that's what you get in 5 hours you get one or two breaks of 3 minutes each right now That is a choice I have made very intentionally based on understanding what I want to teach and how I want to teach it. But at the same time, I need to understand as I'm designing the day, as I'm designing those five hours, how am I going to keep people's energy up? How am I going to keep people paying attention to the most important things I say? How am I going to actually intervene at times when I know that energy is going to be low? So those are all things I have to do as a tradeoff for making the choice of teaching for 5 hours with one break or two breaks maximum of 3 minutes each and so so so you can see how that sort of like that choice manifests from the principle that I shared earlier. Shreas there's another question that I think you could take. Are there any specific student experiences in your course that you're most proud of that drive word of mouth besides besides you know just the great quality of content? I if you want I can I can Yeah, go for it. >> I understand the question. I just want people to perhaps think logically about what I'm about to say. It is impossible to drive word of mouth without great content and the right type of teaching. So the tactics don't matter as much as we think they do, right? And so I guess this also gives me the opportunity to perhaps share that one of the kind of and again you should all see this. I'll repeat and nothing I say is specifically I'm saying you should do this, right? That is not you should take these ideas and think for yourself, right? You should take these as some inputs and think for yourself and do what's best for you for your situation. Right? So what I want to perhaps share and this question gives me an opportunity to share is that a lot of people I find fixate on tactics which is oh what is this little trick you do at the in the middle of the class right or what is some rahrah moment we create or whatever right and yes the tactics matter but that's the small stuff right and the Small stuff only matters once you've gotten the big stuff right. And human nature, the way human nature functions is we gravitate towards the small stuff cuz it's something we can do, right? I heard this instructors give this tactic. I'm going to try it. It feels satisfying. The challenge is that is just one tactic that you heard. There is there's months years of thinking that goes behind creating the actual course material, creating the experience, the words they use, when they prompt their students, what exercises they do, all of those things are informed by the desire and the ability to create a great course. So again, I understand the sentiment behind the question which is well besides creating a great course, what are some ways in which word of mouth can happen? And what I am pointing out is that that is missing the point. The point is the creating the creating the greatest course you can is 98% or 99% of whatever word of mouth you're going to get. Right? So I would ask people to to ask themselves why are we getting attracted to the 1% contributor while not really looking at the 98 99% contributor. >> Yeah. I I want to double down on this a little bit and actually modify it a little bit here, which is that there is no word of mouth moment in Shreas's courses that I found as oh that's designed for word of mouth, but there is a deep level of thought in how to deliver and frame things and insight in the commentary and that does create word of mouth. So the question that I would flip it on you and say actually it's that how do you create levels of aha moments and insights for people that they can then use in their careers that they are watching themselves. They're like wow now that I have this knowledge I am now doing something very differently than I was before. And so nonobvious insights are super important. I do think tactical explanations that are different from what people thought they should do. So, for example, Shrea screen shares videos of people and screen shares. You saw him screen share a text message, right? That's tactical. He's he's giving you a feel behind the scenes. These are instructional design tools that create a good student experience that then do create word of mouth. So, I think you could actually it is a way of thinking. If your goal was to create word of mouth, the way of thinking is how do I create instructional design moments that are mindblowing to the person who is on the other end because that is when you will get the most word of mouth. Right? Think about just think about social media landscape. I've had a social media account that's public for about 10 years or so and it has so heavily moved towards the best content gets the most views as much as possible. the algorithm gods are trying to make that true. Now, they're you can game it with con commenting, you can game it with likes or whatever, but my experience has been that actually my best content gets the most views even if I just walk away after posting it. And my mediocre content, I can make it get slightly more views by DMing all my friends and getting them to comment on it. So, that's I could get 20% more views. Think of that as a similar lesson from Treyas. Now the flip side I'll say is that in future conversations we will have people who will tell you those 20% things that they do that they want to learn and that's that's why what is saying is his sole focus and there will be a percent of people here who will resonate with this is to actually focus on the course itself and that's why we titled this create a transformative course right we're talking about the actual learning delivery and topic choice in those kinds of things rather than how to hack course experience which we are happy to do in the future and I bet there are instructors who are world class at that. >> Can I add something here? Yeah, >> I would encourage and again this is my general philosophy so not diverging at all from it which is when whoever is confused about this point right and it's it's fine to be confused about this because throughout our life we've heard different things we've heard oh do this tactic do my tactic and you'll be successful right I have the best playbook I have the perfect playbook I have the greatest playbook right that is what we've been conditioned towards so it is not it it wouldn't be surprising if some people are confused about this point that it's not about the tactics, it's not about the hacks. Let me just so what I what I usually do is I ask people to think about their own life. So consider in your own life, nothing related to courses. Consider a product or a service. Okay? Consider a product or a service that you couldn't stop telling people about. Think about it. We all have such a product or service. Now ask yourself, did you feel compelled to tell others about it because they did some kind of marketing hack or because you just absolutely loved the product or service? And to what degree did your delight and your love for the product or service prompt you to share with others that, oh, you should really buy this device, you should really do this, I love this. Consider that right? Consider that the point is that some of these ideas nobody needs to take on faith which is oh because I'm sitting here and I'm telling you this consider how your life informs and your experiences inform some of what you might choose to do or not choose to do for your course. >> So thanks Shreas for this amazing session. a lot of love in the chat and also just for being a beacon for everyone here on on Maven and showing the path of of success. And I think one of the things I love the most about your experience is that you seem to just really love it. And I think that's probably something that a lot of instructors can take from this is some of these choices are actually choices very much driven by the fact that Treyos wants to make sure he enjoys this experience. And so he'll make trade-offs. He doesn't like worrying as much about these detailed tactics and he likes thinking about more about the deeper stuff and that's that's part of what makes it fun. other people. We have an instructor. We have instructors who are different and they love the detailed hacks and the clever emails and all of that and that becomes part of their brand and actually that's part of and that actually is funny enough in total not in conflict to Shreas actually if you actually really deeply think about it. It's actually not in conflict. It's actually quite synergistic with his commentary. >> There is a certain art to the hacks as well. So the people who do the hacks they are also pursuing the hacks from the artist's perspective they are actually inventing the hacks right they might follow some hacks but even the ones who are hacking their way there is a certain art and I I think the core point is again this is not about oh just follow what I say I don't care if anybody follows what I say my point is perhaps a point to consider is see what's authentic for discover what's authentic for you and pursue more of that. And when one does that, naturally the end output and the impact of that output will be greater. Right? So perhaps that's one way of thinking about it.
