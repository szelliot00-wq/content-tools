Do you believe AI meaningfully increases a PM's ability to focus on high opportunity work by freeing up time on low value work? >> Yes, AI absolutely creates great leverage for us so that we can devote our time to the highest leverage tasks which minimize opportunity cost. So yes, it absolutely does that. The question is what are the highest leverage tasks? What are the things that I should be working on that minimize opportunity cost? And that most people don't exhibit great judgment on. Let's go with the sales calls or customer call like feedback and notes, right? Among the most important things to get right is to understand why customers are not adopting your product or are buying the product from sales but not actually using it in practice. Whatever the case might be. Let's assume that one has even made that determination that we truly need to understand why that is happening. Okay. If this were true, then it would be an extremely high lever task to spend 8 hours doing nothing but reading verbatim customer comments and sales notes or whatever the heck it is, whatever the inputs are, it would be extremely high leverage. No visible progress made during that 8 hour day. All you did is sat down and stared at a computer screen and you just went through feedback after feedback. Okay, you ended the workday. There is no visible progress. No Slack messages sent, no Google Docs written, no emails sent out, nothing. I would say that is a wonderful day still. And again here I have to trust that one has the baseline skill, right? Because what you have just done by going or what I hope you would have done by going through these hundreds of sales calls transcript with actual what user said is now you have developed a much better understanding true understanding of how your customer thinks and that is what being customer centric is and we are not doing it because it's customercentric we're doing it because we want our product to win right because by spending these 8 hours I would think you now have a much better model of what is going to resonate with the customers but again this requires some baseline skill right so I have to assume the baseline skill exists so in that situation saying yo you know Oh, I want to blah blah blah use my time efficiently, etc. Let me just use AI to summarize. No, not good enough. Nope. On the other hand, say there is some I don't know non-critical issue for which you have to pour through lots of customer comments or whatever qualitative or quantitative data, right? I don't know. Let's just pick something like should we have a support form or should we in addition have a support phone number right there's some decision like that let's assume it's a non-critical decision that we're trying to make and there's some inputs that we have by all means use AI to summarize by all means save your 1 2 3 4 6 hours whatever to summarize I have no problem with that so it's the same task which is evaluating and analyzing raw inputs right it's It's the same kind of task but depending on the leverage it creates for you as a product person in some cases by all means use AI in other cases do not use AI right so one also needs to develop that judgment >> shre us on simple game to improve your AI product sense >> here's a game I want you to try I want you to send a note maybe a slack message to your PM peers and say that you know what every Friday at some designated time you want to play what will AI do game. The game is simple and it can be 30 minutes. Each week, each Friday, pick a topic and really you can pick any topic like nutrition. So this Friday, tomorrow we're going to discuss what will AI do to nutrition. Next week, pick another topic. What will AI do with I don't know taking selfies. And what I want you to do in this session is I want you to discuss with your peer what will AI do. You just apply it to pretty much anything to events or whatever. pick whatever topic to maps and navigation because I think there's just so much creative space that you can explore and not only will this kind of spark ideas for like the day-to-day work you're doing but you never know it might actually spark an idea for something you eventually feel very passionate about. So it's a very lowcost thing and it ends up improving creativity and other things. So very much recommend doing this >> and just to tie it back to the previous conversation you know this is how you gain influence as well. You're not just going to show up and everyone's going to listen to what you have to say. You got to build some credibility and credibility in an area that you're interested in. So, this has two wins here. You build credibility for yourself and you get the org thinking about the possibilities of AI. And I think that's some of the brilliance of this on top of the fact that it'll also just help you learn more because you'll really dive deep into a subject and think >> trees on AI and the future of product teams. Most people that I talk to are not yet understanding the profound effect AI will have on everything about the workplace, including what these jobs mean. >> I get that it's not a novel perspective by any means. the fact that AI is here and it's only going to get better and it is going to impact the way work gets done and therefore it's going to impact our jobs both indirectly and directly. I don't think that part is novel. The part that is I think underappreciated is just how many people don't want to believe that. I still see people saying AI can't do 2 plus 2. I asked chat GPT what is 2 plus two and it said five and so it's stupid right I do get people sharing these kinds of sound bites here's another one I also encounter a lot of situations where people think that their best kind of defense for this kind of change that is happening is oh I should just use more AI tools in my job so that is perhaps another somewhat unique perspective I'll share in my view yes of course you should use AI tools in your job and of course you should use AI assistance where it makes sense of course you should do that that's like saying in 199495 you should really use the worldwide web right like more of course people are going to use the worldwide web more and maybe there were some people who did not but they probably couldn't keep their job in technology if they refused to use the worldwide web so for me that analogy is very applicable here like of course you should be using AI tools but not for one second should you assume that is going to keep your job safe the fact that you are I don't know summarizing customer conversations using some fancy AI tool or the fact that you are I don't know automating parts of your PRDS or updates to tickets or some workflows or you're using AI for data analysis etc etc again there's nothing wrong with it in fact I think more people should do those things where they make sense. But what I'm saying is that if you think that you are safe from AI taking over many parts of the workforce and workplace, I think that would be a mistake. I think that would be a career mistake. My view is that and we're already seeing this. I shared this view two years ago, but we're starting to see this is that roles are going to merge with AI enabling everything it is on the coding side with AI enabling everything it is on the design and prototyping side with AI enabling everything that it is on the analysis and product and workflow management and automation side. We're not going to have these very distinct roles. Oh, here's a product manager and they manage the product and here's an engineer and they write the code and here's the designer and they create mockups and prototypes and here's the data scientist and they do data analysis and various other things and that's the team like oh we're going to have these four key roles or five key roles whatever they are and every team shall have those four to five key roles I don't think that is what the future of product teams is increasingly you're seeing There are many engineers who've always been very product minded. So now they can do a lot more because on the one side AI is making a lot of things efficient on the code generation side of their work. Hey a product minded engineer might actually be a more effective individual on the team than a dedicated product manager. What I tell people is use your own imagination. Right? Chat GPD launched two and a half years ago. Here's how far we've reached in two and a half years. In some ways, if we are product people, imagination is one part of our job, right? We are supposed to be able to use our imagination. Let's imagine what these tools are capable of 3, five, seven years from now and then see what you need to do to still be relevant to still actually perhaps even excel. So that's my general perspective. Now that is for each individual to figure out. Again, I tell people don't take my word for it. Don't believe it because Shrea said so because then it's not going to work. It's not going to last. These are basic things one can think through right. What is air going to be like five years from now, seven years from now? Is it going to be just the same or is it going to be drastically more powerful? And then at that point, what human skills are going to be most important and how can I go develop those skills? That is the million-dollar question. I ran a poll on LinkedIn where I actually asked this question. What is going to basically enable your and your work to still be very relevant in this age where AI is taking over a lot of capabilities. I think the most common answer which I agree was the correct answer is the ability to actually think the ability to think clearly. My view is that for product managers and product people that is going to be even more at a premium because imagine two companies that are competing against each other. Both have very capable AI. So say this is three years from now, five years from now, right? Both have capable AI. They all have PMs who can use AI. So how is one company going to win over the other? They have capable AIs and everybody's trained on AI. Everybody's using AI tools. So what is going to tell us which company wins, right? It's got to go back to the quality of the thinking involved in choosing what to do. And presumably that's being done by humans. So I think that's where the real value is and I don't think enough people are paying attention to that. People are paying a lot more attention to oh let me learn this AI tool which is great like you should learn the AI tool. All I'm saying is that it is necessary not sufficient. >> Shreas on AI and product strategy. >> Product strategy is primarily a creative exercise. Many people don't understand that. They think it's an analytical exercise. But that's why most product strategies that I've seen even at some of the world's best companies, they're not real product strategies. They're a plan, right? They just put a word strategic in front of the plan. They call it a strategy. It's not a strategy. You just listed things to do. So it's that creative piece that is missing in most product strategies and that is really the gap when it comes to creating product strategies. You can go today and ask chat GPT or any other tool to create a product strategy. Give it a bunch of information data. It will write a document and the document will look very impressive. But I would challenge you pay close attention to what it says and then you will see while the format looks very impressive and while it is amazing that it generated it in 5 seconds or less it is lacking creativity. It is lacking true insight. Right? People should use AI more in the analysis of things as a partner in the actual creative thinking process much more than using AI in generation of a document. When it comes to product strategies, I find that many PMs have this disease of give me a template and I'll fill out the template. Anytime a product manager has ever tried to do that, they send me the strategy and again I've seen dozens hundreds of such strategies. It is not compelling. It's just like you try to fill out a template. You just put your next year's plan in the template and you said this is the strategy and your very talented CEO knows that is why you're having difficulty convincing this very talented leader CEO on your strategy. So I think the way to use AI is more for the analytics part for the market research part. AI makes that really efficient today. So that is where I would use it more. The real insight of what we are going to do and why we are going to pick these pets. I still think no AI is going to give you any differentiation on that. >> One hesitation I had before was I'd never taken a live course before. So had no idea what to expect. Didn't know what I was getting into. And it was also I think this is true for some people as well. planning for the whole fiscal year for next year and everything. So, it was like a very chaotic time. My biggest aha moment from today was the creative mindset. I think I used to consider myself a creative person and feel like I very much lost that cuz I've just been working and it's not you're not supposed to be creative. So, lost that. And so, this was like a very I hate using the word inspiring, but it was a very inspiring thing to be like, "Oh, I can retrain that in myself." Like, it's not gone forever. An improvement that I've already started noticing is I think I've asked more questions like more why questions in the past week than I have over the last quarter of like my team members of our customers and then also of myself. I've definitely caught myself being like oh you're just saying this so that you can sound smart in this meeting and then I can hear's voice like nonsense garbage get out of here. Definitely caught myself doing that. And one thing I'd love to try out soon is more of the BTD stuff. as these strategy conversations have been happening in my company, we have not really been thinking about differentiation. It's just what are all the possible things that we should be doing and it becomes a laundry list of features. So excited to think about how we can like narrow that down and then of course re-watching all of these and reading the books and everything. So thank you so much. >> Don't be afraid of AI. >> It's very clear to me that AI is going to change most aspects of what we work on and how we work. And the way I would suggest that product managers think about it is in three categories. So first is what does it mean for the product or products that I manage. Second, what does it mean for team and how we do our work as a team and what might teams look like in the future? What might companies look like in the future? And I'm not talking 10, 20 years from now. I'm even talking 2 3 5 years from now. And the third category is what does it mean for the PM role? what does it mean for my career and my goals? My main suggestion is I want everybody to think about each of these three categories cuz too often I find people are just focused on one of these and not the others. So now let's take each one by one. So the first one which is how does this affect my product? There are a few observations I'll make. If you are in certain categories and industries, you will be completely disrupted by what's happening with AI, right? And so when that is the case, obviously you've got to pay very close attention to what's going on. There are many examples of such categories and verticals. But let's take contact center software, right? I don't think call centers and contact centers and support teams exist in the same way they do right now within 2 3 4 5 years. Now I don't know whether it's 2 years or 5 years, but I know it's that range and that's what matters, right? So what does this mean? If you're building some SAS software for customer support or for contact centers, outbound sales, inbound sales, whatever, you will have to make some really tough choices, even if it's the case that your founder or your CEO or your management is not listening yet or is ignoring the threat, I would recommend that you create a rigorous perspective of what this means and use your influence to continue advocating for what needs to change and how it needs to change and present a compelling and clear plan. Present details if they don't understand the highle stuff. Try different ways of communicating. Take ownership. Don't just sit and say like I guess they don't want to do anything so I'll continue my job cuz you might not have that job. And even if it's hard to advocate for these changes ultimately if you succeed you're actually going to hopefully get appreciated for being the one spearheading and for being the one taking initiative. The second category is like how does this affect teams? How does this affect how work gets done? Clearly, we are seeing all sorts of ways in which it affects how work gets done. You take the typical PM job of oo I'll take notes and the PM always raises their hand and then takes notes and sends it over. Pretty soon AI will generate really good summaries of things. And the interesting part is you have to think about all kinds of access that your AI bot, your meeting bot will have to other meetings and other context that it can bring to you, right? There's all sorts of really interesting things that could happen, right? And you've got to be thinking about that. You've got to be maybe even in some cases an early adopter of that if your organization kind of encourages it or allows it, right? Because it shows initiative, it shows high agency. But here's the most interesting thing on the team front. I think over time teams are going to get smaller because you know designers are going to be much more productive, engineers are going to be much more productive, PMs are going to be much more productive, marketers are going to be much more productive. So what does that mean? When team sizes get smaller, what that means is that you have to do less coordination. So these are things that will impact how you do your work, right? And what teams look like, which then brings me to the last category, which is what does this mean for you as a PM and for your career. So the first thing I want you to be aware of is that the main part of the PM job was never all this kind of taking notes, running SQL, doing basic project management. there are many people who are largely performing that job in a PM role today. It's 60% 70% 80% 90% 99% at times right so as teams shrink as there's more automation what you're going to find is the real part of the PM job becomes more important which is insight into the market insight into the customer insight into the user's mindset creative solutioning high agency influential communication a lot of those things which were the main things that main traits and skills that created at outsized value are going to be even more important and some of these other things the operational things will get commoditized from a skills building perspective from a career growth perspective it's worthwhile to think about how you can intentionally grow your skills if you have some deficiencies in these areas so make an intentional effort to grow those skills because the PMs who do that are going to be able to have much greater job security and are going to be overall sought after by the companies in the next 2 3 4 5 6 years as the way we do our work changes and so I hope this is helpful for folks as they think about how to navigate this don't outsource your judgment to AI question what is the risk of having super intelligence at our fingertips as PMs and could that be a good thing or a bad thing how should we be thinking about the right way to engage with the technology as thinkers >> how many of us are using chat GBD or similar LLM tools for figuring out product stuff, product proposals. Okay, stop doing that. Stop doing that. Like, it's just not good enough yet. It isn't. Okay, I know it's generating neat documents or writeups. I know you're not like just verbatim copy and pasting it in most cases, but you're kind of like using it. Oh, write me this thing, blah, blah. What are you doing? Just stop doing it. It's not good enough yet. I know this. All right, because I've tried. The thing is, you actually have to read critically. Again, for those of you who went to highquality schools, I did not, by the way, but for those of you who did go to a highquality school, you were taught this in like 9th, 10th, 11th grade to read critically. And certainly if you weren't taught this in school, you were taught this in a decent quality college, particularly in the United States. And somehow we've lost that skill as PMS. We just, oh, is it neatly formatted? Does it say all the right business speak? I was like, okay, whatever. Here's the deal. Should I use AI for a conversation to spark ideas? Absolutely. Should I use AI to do some grunt work, some deep research that whatever you need to do where the research is just a reference? It is not the primary source of decision making but it is a reference by all means should I use AI to show some nonsense slide which shows some line chart thingy which shows where the industry is headed just to convince some people that yes there was a chart so therefore this is a rigorous proposal by all means make the chart complicated if you want cuz then people will be like ha yeah it's very smart yes I agree this was such a good presentation Nobody understands the chart but doesn't matter. Doesn't matter. Show some complicated math also like second derivative. Not even complicated math like 12th grade calculus or first year college calculus right every oh Bob Alice you are a very smart PM you showed the second derivative. This is nonsense Okay. So should I use AI for all that? Of course because it's useless work right? But I will tell you today still AI is not good enough for actual insights that will differentiate your product and for actual insights that will differentiate you as a product. You yourself as a PM AI is not yet there. It might get there. It might get there next year or the year after. It's not yet there. So use your judgment. Right? Again develop judgment and use the judgment. I think people should not be using AI to get insights. Again, you can augment yourself with AI. By all means, let me give you a concrete example. So, say you have a feedback form where users are writing verbatim comments about their experience with something, some product, some flow, whatever. Now, these days what happens is that oh, 160 customers filled this out over the last week. Wonderful. So what are people doing these days? That is idiotic. What they do is they give it to chat GPT and they say please summarize this for me. Wrong. You should not be doing that. You should not be doing that. If you want to generate a summary to show to others, by all means do it. Use GPD. I have no problem with that. But if you actually want to learn how the user thinks, if you truly want to understand the user and not just pay lip service to being user centric, if you truly want to understand the user, you must read each and every one of those 160 verbatim comments by users because that is the truth. What chat GPT will do is it'll abstract away all that truth and give you some nonsense like users think there is too much friction. Yo, I don't need to be Einstein to know that users think there's too much friction, but I need to really truly understand the user and how the user thinks and being able to predict the user's behavior better than the user can themselves. And for that skill, you have to train yourself on the source data, not on the summary. Okay? And by the way, if you are getting skeptical right now, again, logically, I'll prove it to you. If Chat GPD is solely trained on Wikipedia articles, would it be as good as it is right now? Yes or no? Cuz when you just put in these 160 verbatim comments into chat GPD like, yo, summarize it for me. You are basically training yourself on what is the equivalent of Wikipedia articles. So, how can your thinking now be that good? So understand this stuff, right? By all means, use AI. But people say, "Oh, this is another nonsense. AI will not take your job, but a person using AI will." This is just like stupid Don't believe this stuff. What is this nonsense? Of course, everybody's going to be using AI tools. It's like saying in 1993 that the internet will not take your job or the worldwide web will not take your job. somebody using the worldwide everyone is going to use AI right everyone who is driven motivated smart is going to use AI so it's how you use AI how you use AI to augment the raw skill that you have the product skill that we are talking about the craft right it's how you use it that matters and where you use it that matters not the fact that you use it oh look at AI generated the first draft of this document it's like useless By the way, this whole first draft thing is also stupid because now what happens? You think, "Oh, I have the blank page syndrome. If I'm staring at a blank page, I can't do anything. I get paralyzed." I get it. I get it. This is a real issue, right? So therefore, to get over the blank page syndrome, I'll ask AI to create something and then I'll update it. Here's the problem. Do you realize that now your job you have changed from thinking original thoughts to editing and updating that first draft and the moment you do that it is not going to be as good. So understand that >> how AI will redefine product leadership. Yes, product leadership is in trouble medium to longterm. There's just going to be fewer people. So, lesser overhead, lesser management stuff, lesser reporting up and down, you know, stuff like that. So, yeah, it's in trouble and it's more and more going to be about creating clarity. It's more and more going to be about that true insight. It's more and more going to be about fostering creativity. So yes, they will continue to shrink and role expectations will continue to broaden to more of that kind of product generalist. A long time ago, this is before even I think chat GPT, I had said that there's going to be only one role which is PM, but PM as in product maker, not product manager. And so an engineer will be a PM, a designer will be a PM, a PM will be a PM. You had 20 person teams right now. There's probably like a team of three PMs. They might have some in-depth specialization, but they're able to do many different things thanks to AI. So now if a 20 person team shrinks to three people, there's going to be less management overhead. There's going to be less coordination overhead. And think about what these other 17 people are going to do because over time, every organization will be more efficient like this. So yeah, this idea of pure management can be trouble. Pure people management, pure coordination, pure reporting, pure navigating the org, I think is a troubled place to be. I could be wrong. People are continuing to underestimate just how quickly things are changing and will continue to change. >> How PMs can incorporate AI into their work. >> Thing I wanted to share on this topic of AI is something I had tweeted to my super followers. Actually, I'll just let you read this tweet that I'd shared with my subscribers because I think it is first really important to recognize this, right? So, there's a lot going on with AI and we see AI everywhere and I see a lot of this kind of sometimes reluctance and almost fear of trying to engage with what's going on with AI. And I just wanted to call out that often times this reluctance is rooted in our fear of missing out on a big wave or fear of having to learn something new or just fear that we'll become obsolete. Right? So sometimes it's easier for us to just ignore what's going on and create a rational reason around it. Oh, it's hype and I just want to do my job. I don't want to bother with all this AI stuff right now. But what I want to share at least my perspective on AI on is which is and again this is something like I shared many months ago before chat GPT and other things launched is that I firmly believe that AI is this next big wave in technology and I just want to call out that like in our lifetimes we'll only see a few big waves in our career and I do strongly believe that AI is it right and before this was mobile and mobile wasn't that big but in the 2008 2009 period is when we saw mobile and before that was the worldwide web right like we don't see many of these in our lifetime and in some ways we are lucky to be in the middle of this right now I think if you just recognize this truth and if you are feeling reluctance and fear instead of ignoring that fear like just accept the fear because that's the only way you'll take the next step right so if you're then ready to take the next step right what is to be done so first I'll split it into a few categories so category one is I would highly recommend commend that you use AI products and you can use them for your work for your product manager job right that sort of stuff is like obvious and I know many people are doing it but I'll perhaps share some non-obvious things you can use chat GPT for first one is when you are having a difficult conversation now as product people we often have difficult conversations with people and what I find is that like most of the anxiety and most of the problems that occur from difficult conversations is basically a messaging problem. So if we can message much better, we can be a lot more effective and influential. You can actually use something like chat GPT today to tweak your message, right? Say you want to have a conversation with somebody about them not kind of being as engaged on certain tasks and missing deadlines or whatever the case might be. You can literally go to chat GPT, describe the situation and then it will provide a response to you. And most people stop at that response and say, "Okay, I'll tweak it." But what many people don't realize is that you can further ask chat GPT to refine the response for you. You can say, "Is there a different word for this thing that you used or could you reframe this to make this a little softer?" Or give me four or five different options for how I might say it. And again, I'll just share a quick example. I did this for a tweet. What I'm showing you here is I had this kind of tweet that I wanted to write and it was a little difficult because I wasn't sure how to express a certain competitor. Basically, I went through this whole process of hey chat GBT what is a good way to say that a company's past its peak right then it gave me something and then I said but how about this? Is there any better way to frame that? And and then it said I said okay now this is my current version. How is this? And then I asked it for three or four variants, right? Like and on. Again, the point is not like I I'm just showing this as an example for a tweet. But the point is you can do this for anything, right? Any kind of communication. So I would highly recommend that you do that. Now I'm not just recommending that you do these things for just the sake of your job. Although that is already a very good reason to do it. The second category I want you to pay attention to is as you use these products, you will get ideas for how to incorporate and how to make your current product better. And there are probably a couple of couple of variants here. One variant is that you work on a product that is likely to get completely disrupted with AI, right? And there are plenty of examples of such products. Many kind of SAS products fall in that category. For instance, like if you're doing anything any contact center SAS thing, right? A lot of your users are actually going to disappear overnight and that impacts all sorts of things including your per seat pricing and it basically impacts everything. So there are entire categories that are going to get disrupted, right? So that's one reason why you need to understand what the potential of these tools is and the only way you'll understand the potential of these tools is by using it. The second is where maybe your product is not going to get disrupted but you ought to be thinking about what sort of features will create differentiation in your product where you're using generative AI or other kind of new approaches right so that's the second category I wanted to call out third category is and I know this is something PMs are often like wondering about will my job get obsolete here's my belief about that question my belief is that what is going to happen is that teams are going to get significantly smaller So that's number one. A result of teams getting significantly smaller for the same amount of work is that there is less coordination overhead. An impact of that of less coordination overhead is that now the project management aspect of product management is going to be less important. It's still going to be a key part of it, but it's just going to be less important than it is right now. Right? Simply because the teams are smaller. So that's number one. Number two, you are going to be in a situation where the main part of the PM role is going to become even more important while these other commodity things are basically going to be much easier to do. Basically, you will not be spending 3 hours writing some complex five table join SQL and marveling at the beauty of the SQL you wrote and sharing it with your colleagues so they can appreciate the SQL you wrote, right? That is just not going to be as vital for your job. What is going to be vital is your judgment, your judgment, your instinct and creativity. Because in a world where everybody has access to these AI tools, what is going to happen is the differentiation is going to be created by what you do with all of this, right? And that still boils down to creativity and it boils down to insight and it boils down to empathy for the customer. So as you're thinking about how you should think about your skills and how to adapt to this future, I would say it is very vital that you understand how to grow your empathy, how to grow your ability to have better judgment, so clear thinking and how to improve your creativity because those parts of the job I firmly believe are the ones that will help you create better products than your competitor who has access to the very same AI tools. So my main recommendation here would be as you think of the long term, please invest in upskilling in those areas because that's going to ensure that you have very high job security and that you're still able to make a massive impact in the products you work on. >> Usually when we do strategy in a product team, it's like a linear process like hey here's the problems we heard in UX research and hey here's the data opportunity. But this really helped me realize like it's it's not this like linear process, a very creative process. The second one is I've been in product for a long time and I don't think I've ever seen good segmentation until today. And then we looked at a lot of examples that really like helped that land with me. Um especially the example of our shares courses uh segmentation actually I thought that was very interesting. uh PM leadership in the AI age. >> I just find it super fascinating that we still at a place where a lot of people are just discounting and underestimating what is going on including people in product. I hear some common things. Number one, there's some post about AI and I'll read a comment which is like that's all good but nothing can replace real humans and human empathy and emotions. I'm sure you've seen some version of that somewhere and then again the people rally behind that opinion. So now it appears like elevated and therefore in this age of social media it appears correct to us is okay so many people are agreeing that like nothing can replace human emotion, nothing can replicate human emotion. Okay, cool. I have some news for you. I would say today like I'm not talking about future models today already every model that I've tried shows greater human empathy than the median director or VP level person at a tier one company in the valley that is today right and how do I know this because I have chatted with these LLMs and I've asked them questions about interpersonal situations and this is with the intent of testing them which is do you follow why this is the wrong response the conventional response to your direct report this is the wrong one I just ask the question I don't give it the answer I just asked there's something wrong here and I know that the median director to VP level person at a tier one company in Silicon Valley would not be able to figure it out and chat GPT or Claude or Gemini will figure it out either up front or after two or three nudges and It's those two or three nudges that I also want to call out because it took me two or three reprompts but at no point did I ever give it the answer. All I said is no claude this answer is incorrect. Try again. That's all I said. And then it eventually after two or three maximum prompts it reached a roughly very high quality answer of why it's incorrect and what is correct. Then I said what if I did this with the median VP director person like how would that conversation go and that's when I realized that like that conversation is impossible because the individual is not going to be open they're going to argue and of course I won't say you are wrong etc. Let's assume that I'm very thoughtful about how I nudge them. But it it'll take me like 3 4 hours and even then there is very little success of the individual developing that insight that is driven by empathy. So that's the state right now. I mean it's pretty clear to me that basically a lot of these things that people say oh this is a uniquely human attribute or quality or skill. I just don't think that is true already today. So that's one observation I wanted to make. People are just underestimating how good this thing is. Second is people are also underestimating like how good this thing is going to be. There are a lot of people even in product who are like it can't do math right or whatever. Can we use our imagination? Supposedly one of our core attributes as product people is being able to use our imagination. So what like progress is going to stop in 2 years or can you figure out like how powerful and how correct and good this thing is going to be 3 years from now 5 years from now you don't need to be a domain expert to figure it out this is again the quality of imagination I usually don't use analogies but sometimes I have to use an analogy to explain that it's no different than complaining in 1994 that these browsers suck and It takes me like 10 minutes to download an image, right? And it gets stuck half the way and then the internet dialup connection drops. You could say that the worldwide web is just like complete garbage in 1994. And maybe you even sound smart cuz the critic always sounds smarter. But what's the point? So that's I guess another observation I make. Third, relevant to products. What I'll say is couple of things. Number one, I think a lot of existing companies, the incumbents, one mistake they're making is they're just bolting AI on top of an existing product. And I understand why. Classic innovators dilemma and user retraining tax at work, but they're bolting AI on top of existing UI and UX and it's just not working well. As a user, I can see that. So, that's one sort of challenge I'll pose to product leaders and founders and CEOs. that if you are indeed going to commit to this kind of oh yeah we are AI first then in some cases again use your judgment but in some cases it's okay to be a little bolder so that's one thing I'll say second thing I'll say is specifically in terms of its impact to PM and how product gets built and all of those considerations I think people are also underestimating the degree to which teams of the future are going to be smaller and still able to get the amount of work done that they're getting done with 10x the size right now or even more. I can totally see a team in 2 3 4 5 years from now that has three people where right now that same team for the same output is 30 people or even more. That is very clear that is not controversial generally from all the conversations I've had. But then I say okay so what are the second order effects of that for product leaders? The fewer the people you have the less the coordination. So a lot of your time that you spend in coordination and in people issues and various other things and general day-to-day just management of people. So that has now reduced significantly. Okay great. Now some people say okay but maybe we'll just build more features. There'll be more code because there'll be more features, there'll be more capabilities. And by all means, yeah, I kind of subscribe to that too. But now, who's the entity that is going to decide what is good? Who's the entity that is going to decide what we are going to ship and why we are shipping that in a world where our capacity to ship is much greater. And the people who are super intelligent in this area, no pun intended, basically tell me that at some point that entity will be AI at some point, like when we get to some version of super intelligence, that entity might be AI. I don't know. I'm not educated enough on this to have confidence. Who knows if it's 5 years, 10 years, 20 years from now. People don't seem to agree. Experts don't seem to agree. But in the meantime, it's got to be a human, right? The person who's kind of deciding what is good and why. And so my question to people, and now you bring it to your personal self and your specific career, is are you going to be that person or not? Because that's going to be the highest leverage job, right? So are you the one who's going to have that job or not? And if that is something you are inclined to be, and you don't have to be, but if that is something you're inclined to be, what are the skills you need to be able to do a better job than most people out there? And I feel people are not thinking critically about this. And again, all of this is very logical, right? You don't have to take any of this on faith other than the timelines, which you know, I'm not an expert in. But the question is, are you building those skills? And that's where I think people are still not building those skills. And yes, using AI tools is good and using AI tools in your daily workflow is great and you should all do this. It's saying you should download and use a browser and go to websites in the year 1994 9596 when if you were in tech. Of course you should do that. Of course you should do that. That's where most people are stopping. They're not thinking about skills beyond using current AI tools for productivity related reasons. They're not thinking about what are the unique human skills that are still going to be important such that you are the one who is the person deciding what is good, what we are going to build in a world of near infinite capacity. So those are some thoughts that I would leave people with. Staying ahead in the AI age. >> This topic of AI is interesting particularly in the context of product managers, product leaders. By the way, when I say product leader, you could be an engineering manager or an engineering director or a design manager or even somebody who's working on products on the marketing side. I bundle all of that under product leader. So product leader doesn't just mean a manager of PMs. It can be much broader than that. A founder is a product leader. If you're a founder of your company and you're the main product person, then you're a product leader, right? So in the context of PMs and product leaders with AI, two main observations. One, people are too short-term focused. So that's one observation and I'll expand on what I mean by that. And the second is most people don't understand how drastically AI is going to impact the workplace in general. I think a lot of times especially say if you work at a large company you might hear from your CEO at all hands if somebody asks a question like oh is AI going to replace our jobs most likely your CEO is going to say no don't worry about it. We've also seen articles maybe where some CEOs say, "Oh, actually we think AI is going to increase the number of jobs." I don't think that is true. I think we are severely underestimating how good this thing is going to be in 2 years, in 5 years, and certainly in 10 years. This thing is going to be really good. Right now, I don't think chat GPT or these other tools are actually writing very good docs. I know people are using it and I actually the way I see people using these things and saying like oh write me a strategy doc I look at that strategy doc and I'm like this is not a good strategy doc I don't like it and I can tell easily this is not written by a human being and it is also not very good and the same for PRDs and other things that said this thing is going to get really good look I don't have a crystal ball and there's always a danger with predictions because you could be wrong my point of you is that on a long enough time horizon I do not know if it is 3 years if it is 5 years or 10 years but I know it is not 25 years on that time horizon say up to 10 years a lot of what we do day-to-day as product managers and product leaders we are not going to need to do we are seeing this already like if you're a junior product manager working on a highly mature product you're spending a lot of time on analytics you're running queries of all sorts and you're spending a lot of time doing SQL and various other things. Well, guess what? We're already seeing now you can just ask the question, you don't have to write this fancy five table join that took you 6 hours to write. You just don't have to do that. And that is just going to continue. A lot of these kind of secondary jobs you used to do like taking meeting notes is another example, right? AI is okay with meeting notes now. It's going to only get better. So you're not going to have to send out all these action items and all of that as an example. So a lot of these kind of supporting jobs of a PM which took up a lot of time. I used to write SQL to get some information about how users are using something. I I'm Oracle certified SQL DBA back from my engineer days. But it still took me several hours to write it, right? Not going to need that. So that's the first observation. A lot of the supporting jobs of a product manager, they're just going to be done much better with AI. Second observation is teams of the future for the same amount of product scope are going to be much smaller, significantly smaller. So maybe right now for some feature or product you manage, you have 15 engineers, maybe you have a designer, you just fast forward a few years, you're not going to need 15 engineers for that scope. Maybe you'll just need three or five engineers to get the same amount of scope handled and the rest AI is doing, right? But this now creates a problem because now if the team is smaller, it creates two problems for you as a product manager. One, there's not that much co coordination overhead anymore. Even on the marketing side, marketing teams are going to be smaller. Support teams are going to be smaller. We already seeing that with support. It's very clear what's happening there. So teams are going to start getting smaller. That means that the coordination aspect of your job which for some product managers takes up 80 90% of your time today and rightly so it's fine that it takes up 80 90% of your time today but as a team gets smaller you're not doing that much more coordination you're doing way less coordination there will be some coordination but it's way less so what is going to be your differentiator as a product manager is the thing you have to be thinking hard about. I'll also make another kind of prediction. As these teams get smaller and they're still managing meaningful features or meaningful products with a much smaller team, you'll find that the lines between who's a designer and who's a an engineer and these titles are not going to exist in the future because again we are already seeing it with design tools today. like you can declaratively create pretty decent UX marks and prototypes. You don't need to be a designer who went to design school for 4 years or architecture school for 5 years or whatever. You don't need that anymore for a lot of things that you need to do. We've all worked with a few engineers who are actually very versatile. They can write code but actually they could be very good PMs. In fact, many of them go from engineering to product management at some point and they also have good design sense. So imagine a world where the engineering teams are getting smaller. You could have an engineer who can basically do a lot of your product job. That engineer is already doing some design work as well and is doing some engineering work. So again the question is where are you going to differentiate? Now at this point the common answer you'll see on Twitter and LinkedIn is oh you should start learning how to code. That's a bad answer. I don't think that's a good call. I used to be an engineer and I became pretty much useless within three years of being a product manager. And yeah, sure, I can write code, but that's not going to be my differentiator ever. So, what I want you to really think hard about is how are you going to differentiate? And then I have some answers, some opinions on how product managers are going to be able to differentiate. And for that you have to kind of play this out to second and third order effects right okay so now in this future world again 3 years 5 years 10 years from now you'll have all these AI tools and agents and who knows kind of doing a lot of the work that you are doing today these tools are going to be built by some companies potentially now I want you to think about your competitor your competitor will also be using these same tools they're going to be using the A+ PRD generator tool right They're going to be using the A+ meeting summarizer tool and they're going to be using the Slack summarization tool. So you don't have to read through Slack in the morning to catch up on everything. You just get, you know, Jarvis style just updates on what you need to know. So your competitor and you have access to the same AI tools. You're both writing PRDS using these tools. You're both designing mocks using these tools. You're both writing code using these tools. So, how are you going to differentiate against your competitor? How are you going to make your product more successful than your competitor's product? And the answer to that is through better insights. You will need better insights, better than AI insights about your customers, your users, your competitors, the market, the regulation, the laws and all the rest. So, AI will give you some insights. AI will summarize some things for you and again I'm telling you it's going to be really good but your competitor also gets that really good stuff. So how you going to beat them? How you going to build a more successful product? You are going to need better than AI insights. For that you are going to need to understand human beings better than you do today. You are going to need to understand customer behavior better than you do today. You're going to need to understand market dynamics better. So that's one aspect you'll need is insights. Insights are going to differentiate you, make your product more successful. Insights are not enough to build a successful product because insights are an input. Once you understand, oh, actually customers say that they want A, but my insight is that they actually want B. That's a great insight, but that's not going to entirely make you successful. You need one more thing after that insight which is you need creativity cuz you need to convert that insight into a creative product solution and over there there are hundreds thousands of possibilities how of how you convert an insight to an actual product we I mean this is what we do all day like okay we try to build this product oh we had this problem so now we need to find a creative solution to this oh sorry our tool cannot send email to more than 10,000 people. Okay, we need to figure out how to batch those emails. So, you're constantly trying to be creative, right? You're going to need even more of that creativity. And that is something you can beat AI on even when AI gets really sophisticated because by definition, AI will only be training on the corpus of existing knowledge that it has access to. And by the way, AI can be pretty creative today. Like AI can write a better poem than I can, right? because I'm not naturally good at poetry. So AI can write a better poem than I can. But if somebody is like really great at poetry, it's going to be a while before AI can beat that person. Just like I'm pretty good at strategy, so it's going to be a while before AI can beat my product strategy document. And again, product strategy is nothing but insight plus creativity. So I want you all to really think hard about where you are skill-wise on insight and on creativity because I believe that is what is going to differentiate your product and that is what is going to keep your job relevant in the future era when AI is doing everything else. And the good news is some people are already pretty good at this. They are really good at this. They're top 10% already. In which case great, you're lucky you are more likely to survive. what's going to happen with AI. But I would still say like don't rest on that because again AI is going to get continually good at this. So keep turning your strengths into your superpowers. And by definition, not all of us can be in that top 10%. Right? There is the 90% that's not in the top 10%. But this is where I'm saying that a lot of people today are basically choosing to ignore AI. It's like, oh yeah, it's not going to change anything. It's not going to change much. Yeah, sure. We'll incorporate AI in our product, but it's not going to affect my job. I know it's natural to feel that way because it's just a scary thought that AI is going to impact our job. But the only way you can future proof yourself is if you just accept that and then if you're in that remaining 90% create a road map for yourself of how you going to upgrade your skills. Again, my answer is yes, you will need to upgrade your skills if you want to deal with what's AI is about to unleash on all of us. Okay, you will need to upgrade your skills, but you need to be smart about upgrading the right skills. I think it's a really poor idea to learn coding now to counter the AI threat. Sure, you can do some coding. Sure, you can understand how to read code, maybe whatever, but that is not the thing that's going to differentiate you. insights and how you get to better insights and how you can constantly come up with better and more creative solutions is what's really going to help you tackle this post AAI world. >> The one future proof product skill in the AI age. >> I think that aspect can be considered fairly logically. The aspect that is hard to consider logically at least for me given my own limitations is just all the societal effects and the political ramifications. But if you're getting to the specifics of what can I as an individual who's working in technology, what sort of alpha can I get or how might I go about getting that alpha? There are two possibilities. One is AI is doing everything meaning there are no humans in any commercial decision making roles even the CEO is basically an AI right so let's just say that is possible it's at least worth entertaining that possibility maybe it is the most rational place that we end up in that like you have no humans in the loop whatsoever. In that case, what are you going to do? There's nothing one can do. There's nothing that is going to ensure any degree of differentiation for you or me as an individual and I can't quite tell what happens to people in that situation. I really don't know. So that's one possibility. The other possibility one can entertain is okay AI is really powerful right it's super intelligence meaning the degree of intelligence that most of us can't even comprehend say there is an ant inside a Boeing 777 or whatever 747 does the ant understand all the marvelous engineering and the thinking that went behind this object that the ant is in. I think a reasonable answer would be no. The ant has no idea. And so we might end up in a similar place where we are the ant. And we cannot even conceive what this higher form of intelligence is capable of. Odds are that in that scenario again we end up in the first branch of this logic tree where it's like what value are humans going to add then just what value does an ant add to the operation of this amazing aircraft? Zero. So again that's a possibility. But let's take another possibility where it's okay. We still need some humans in the loop. And why do we need them? Maybe we need them for liability reasons. We need them for ensuring that AI doesn't kill all of us. That AI doesn't occasionally create tremendous damage, whether direct damage or collateral damage. And for those cases, even in businesses, we need some humans in the loop. We need some humans to make the final calls for accountability, liability or safety reasons. So that is a possibility too. Now by definition that means it is not going to be hundreds of thousands of humans doing it at a Microsoft or a Google or a Meta or whatever. It's probably going to be a handful of humans, a few humans. I don't know what the order of magnitude is but I think it's safe to say it's not in the thousands. So now the question is if one still chooses to engage in some occupation profession then obviously the question is how do you ensure you are one of those handful of dozens of hundreds of human beings that are still valuable enough and whose judgment is still sound enough that you would be that human in the loop. So if that is the case, it's a big if. But if that is the case, if that's where we end up in the next 15 years, then the natural question is okay, do you want to be that person? And if you want to be that person, okay, what does it take to be that person? Clearly by definition, what it takes is an extremely an extraordinary degree of judgment and clarity of thought. and some degree of courage. So to me those are the everlasting skills. Now they may not last forever but they will last for as long as human skills are relevant. And so it all then goes back to what is one doing right now to develop that judgment. And it again by definition has to be worldclass judgment. And it means that very few will ever succeed in doing it. And then the question goes back to do I care enough to be trying to do this. It's again there is no faith required here. There's no authority proof or bias required here which is oh shas is saying it so you should pay attention or you should not pay attention. All of this is just pure logic right there is no faith involved here. Now here's another way to provoke this line of thinking which is let's say we have extremely powerful AI and by the way most people I don't think use their imagination enough to figure out like how powerful it's going to be in 10 years from now. It would be highly surprising if it is not extremely powerful 3 5 10 years from now. So let's assume a world where again there are still organizations and companies that are competing to provide products, services, entertainment, whatever to others. And this is not where I'm savvy enough. Will everything just be government controlled? Will there just be one government branded media company and one government branded SAS company and one government branded AI company? Maybe that happens in some countries. I don't know. I'm not savvy enough to know that. But let's assume we are in a world where there's still private companies, private organizations that are competing for revenue, market share in a given market. Big assumption perhaps. I don't know. And certainly we can say 3 4 years from now we'll still be in that world. I just don't know if we'll be in that world 10, 15, 20 years from now. Okay. So now you still have very powerful AI. You have more than one company competing in a given space. Every company has great AI. So who wins? What decides who wins? Right? Because every company has great AI. You have to assume that because if they didn't like like that would be very clear. So if you're using I don't know OpenAI's model and it's not that great anymore. The rational thing to do would be to switch to whatever model your competitor is using or to use all the models. Right? The point is in a world where you have a highly capable AI, highly powerful AI, but you're still in a world where companies are competing for share. Well, which company's going to win? It's a very logical question. And what is your answer to that question? Forget it. In this future world, what's your answer to that question right now? What most people don't realize is the only correct answer to the question is the quality of the thinking. That is the ultimate answer to the question of which company executes better is the quality of the thinking. Timeless skills for product leaders in the age of AI. It turns out it's the very same skills that were always important. And what is that? It is some version of judgment, product sense, and strategic sense. And related to that, the discernment of what is actually good and why it is good. and being able to explain that which is essentially what taste is. People these days talk a lot about taste and taste as being a defense for you in this AI world and I generally agree but one thing that is missed still and underappreciated is that actually a large part of taste is being able to understand why something is good or not good and being able to communicate that to others. Because we've all worked with a product leader or executive who's extremely talented, has great taste. We give a presentation to them proposing some flow or something. They don't like it and they share that but there is no explanation for why or they struggle to explain why. Now we're just left confused, right? And they're not left in any better state other than we know this is not good or this will not get approval from them. So like taste and if you listen closely Steve Jobs has talked about this in the past that actually this communication piece is an important aspect of taste that people are not covering. So anyway, the general area of product judgment, product strategy, expertise, product sense, taste, they've always been important, right? They've always been important. And if you look at product leaders who've had consistent success, so not well placed, right time, but consistently successful throughout their career, they had this skill set or they developed this skill set over time. I mean that was partly responsible for that consistent success. I don't think it is fundamentally an entirely different thing that is going to be like that differentiator. It's just that now these things are even more important in a world where there is a much higher capacity 10x 100x,000x maybe even greater than that capacity. It all goes back to the correctness of the decisions you're making. >> Hesitation is it actually going to be worth it? the time, the money, the effort, and yeah, it has been sifting through all the courses like I've seen this before. Is this really going to add value? Is it another framework? And this has just turned all of that on its head, which I did not expect, which has been delightful. The aha moment today was actually really near the end of the lecture when you just realize the genius in some of the creative execution. You're just like, how do people even come up with those things? and realizing that there is some way I can guide myself to that process through constant applying my mind to how people have made effective decisions and executed creatively. And a clear improvement is actually partly a sliver of the matrix is going out in the world and being like, oh, why was that decision made? I can see that how have they segmented? What's the positioning? It's just to your point, Tra, it's like applying product sense to everything that you do and looking at every decision made, every product offered and unpacking and decomposing how they potentially came up to that decision or that moment of execution. So, a massive thank you. I will miss you. I will miss the team overall who joined, but also as you described yesterday, don't be attached to it. Take what you've learned and start where you are. So, yeah, thank you so much. I just have observations that I have seen myself go through in the last few days. I think one is I thought it was going to be a huge disadvantage not having ever been a PM in my entire career and to now be a founder building a product and I thought this is going to be a huge disadvantage but coming in I realized that I didn't have baggage and I noticed that a lot of those things just made sense but also what that led to which was really beautiful is I don't know what I don't know I think that was a huge part of building products that I could have never figured out had I not come to this class. Second is I think this course felt more like a spiritual practice like the closest experience I've had to something like vipasa and I also specifically say that because there is so much to understanding how I think as a person and I think everything follows my own biases and unless I've uncovered those I'm not going to uncover further and I I think more than learning something new for me the biggest unlock has been catching myself making the same mistakes consistently now so at least I know the mistakes I make rather than I'll come to the learning part I think that's a whole other world I'm going to take much longer I'm going to keep revisiting this course multiple times I can definitely say that it's also literally 2:15 a.m. here for me and I've done this and woken up at 5:00 a.m. for the AMA. I don't remember any time in my entire 32 years of existence having ever done this. So it says something about the subtleties with which you taught this course. I think it's once in a millennia. So I'm just very fortunate. They they say this in vipasna that the first thing is uh you have to have had a lot of good karma to even hear about something like vipasna and you have to have had even more good karma to have the opportunity to do those 10 days of vipasna. I think for me this was it this was the closest next to that. I don't have any questions but I just really wanted to share this. So, thank you so much
