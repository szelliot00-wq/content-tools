Um this week we've got uh Carlotta joining with us. Super lucky to have Kotta speaking with us. She's a former CPO at GIFGAF. She's now um a product coach and I guess product consultant. You're helping companies and individuals uh be be better product people. Um Carlos is going to talk to us um about her experience at GIFGAF and how they really em embraced product principles. But that's probably enough for me. I will hand over to Carter. She's going to talk for I think 30 minutesish and then we'll have some questions um at the end. >> Thank you. Thank you, Ed. Um yeah, so I want um Oh, let's get us straight into the topic because I think there's enough of me throughout the whole uh presentation and nothing that you really need to know about me right now. um what we're going I'm I'd love to talk to you about this and I was so excited when Ed asked me uh to have um run through it once again uh with you um is that this has been absolutely the bulk of uh my experience at GEIFG. Um I was there for CPO. Um I left about a year and a half ago because as Ed said I wanted to uh prove myself on as a consultant as an adviser and have more variety and flexibility probably in my life but it has been an incredible journey that the team is bringing forward um and they are keep building incredible products that I hope you um as potential members might be uh experiencing very soon. Um, but I'll tell you in a nutshell why we wanted to build a world-class product organization. Um, what it meant to us, um, what we did well and what actually really we didn't get right. I'll be very authentic and honest and I'm very happy to take any questions that might feel even a bit controversial, uncomfortable to you. I'm sure I've been through it. Uh, and I had to get my head around it for a long time. So, um I think the benefit is for you to uh really ask me whatever um you potentially are struggling with and what you um might be wanting to really hear uh from me. a very unfiltered um um you know conversation obviously in the respect and confidentiality you know of an organization that I'm you know I'm not part of uh with anymore uh officially even though um I retain really strong ties with them and with majority of the leadership team that they um right now um so starting from the very beginning um why we wanted to um move forwards and and build a work as product organization at GIFGAF. Um, so there were three main levers that we kept coming back to. Um, and one was the market condition. So you might know that the telecommunication market is pretty saturated, is highly competitive, the margins are shrinking. Um, and we knew that as a team, as a leadership team, we had to keep stay on top of our game, still generating more revenue, keep growing, um, delivering real value for our members, which is the way gift calls their own customers. Um, and so you might have heard of GIF broadband more recently that has been launched officially and that, for example, was one of the things that, um, we were trying to do at the time. How do we launch for example broadband and other products um in the best possible way uh so that we generate um incremental revenue um but a big driver as well was um operational efficiency. So you might know that GIFGAF was built without a customer care uh because um there was a there is still a community uh that helps uh the the members and members help each other and that kept our opex line really really flat. Um, GIFA has always been a very agile, nimble company and we knew that to be able to keep growing but we by keeping the our operational efficiency uh we had to um to you know to be really productive and creative with our product teams we needed to get the best value out of the teams. Um and then there was also um an emerging theme around people and I mentioned this quite candidly because I'm sure you might be seeing the same in your organization. At some point we started perceiving a bit of a fraction between product and tech the rest of the company um uh you know maybe marketing. GIF was born with a strong brand. Um you if you remember potentially the first ad they were quite quirky they were uh particularly interesting and funny and well positioned within the industry and we were doing things really really differently. Um but at some point I think there were kind of two souls in the organization that were quite not able to communicate in the most effective way. So we wanted to address um that piece as well because we were concerned that that would um you know what wouldn't propel us forward in the growth that we wanted to um reach. Um and so I put I put this slide in because I thought let me spell out exactly what we meant. Um because sometimes we just assume what that means. Um and um and we had a lot of debate as well about what being a product ccentric organization really meant. Um, and we went by kind of the the Kagan definition and we decided that we wanted to, you know, ground ourselves into a bit, you know, in a methodology and into a framework that already existed as opposed to building our own version so that everyone could read stuff out and could recognize themselves like a salesperson, a finance person could just research and, you know, do the cognitive load of thinking, oh, I I get now maybe what that means to you. It's not just Carlott as a CPO that wants us to do this this and that. And I'm mentioning I'm stressing this because I don't know it was a consideration we made like for a long time we were wondering what that really meant to us. Um and also I was chatting with Ed just before this this talk and we banned a few words in the organization. The first firm uh word to ban was the t word. We used to call it transformation under the assumption that majority of transformations do fail and people feel that they are done to them as opposed to being part of one of those. And and in many organizations sometimes there is a transformation manager, a change manager. Um and that was not the approach that we wanted to take. We wanted the whole company being on board. That meant actually that probably some things took us a longer time than expected and I'll tell you all about it. Um, but we didn't want to use that transformation piece. And another thing um that we tried to steer away from was really talking calling out a productled organization or a product centric organization um because again sounded at that everything was about the product and was easily misunderstood. So obviously as a CPO and a product person I was living and breathing those principles but I always tried to make the effort of translating those into what that actually meant uh for everyone. Not saying I was always great and good at doing it um but I prefer to call it out because it was a conscious effort that we all made as a leadership team. So um what we meant by you know building you know work-class product organization we wanted to build products that were really answering users needs and we're not just tick the box like typical telco style oh I've got a great business gates it's going to make us billions and then it does nothing reference intended um we wanted obviously to use the products that we the new products um generated as the marketing tool and GIF Cafe has always grown massively via referrals and we felt that you know that principle of creating an amazing product that people talk about um was absolutely at the essence of our company our operating model and and very you know very much part of the principles and the success criteria that we wanted to set for ourselves. um we wanted to see analytics flowing through free between all the teams and this was a big struggle and I'll tell you a bit more about it later and obviously we believed in um building by iterations experimenting um and finally essentially and this is also something that triggered as you can imagine majority of emotions and um maybe some resistance is that we want well or I would I imagine all the business functions being allow aligned around the success of the product. Um so I didn't want people to feel part of their own department marketing sales finance. Uh but what I really wanted to create and inspiring to people is that they were feeling they were contributing to the launch of gift broadband of contracts or phones whatever products they were working for um no matter the department they were coming from. And this was one of my biggest dreams and probably one of the most difficult ones um to to achieve. Um so to give you a bit of a more understanding of where we were and where we wanted to go to um GIF Cap had been super successful in the market in terms of growth. Um I think in creating really committed engaged uh loyal members. Um and as I said the marketing was a big factor into it and I think the role of finance was also crucial um had been crucial up to that point because our um P&L was very lean in so many ways. Um uh so we were coming from a an approach an operating model where marketing, sales and finance were pretty strong uh voices in the company. Um but at the same time we had there were a few things that were not working. We had very aggregate business goals. We were talking about revenue and profit like typical kind of big CEO levers but we were not so good at cascading down what that was meaning for every person in in the company. And that led to a collective sense of ownership which is great um in a way culturally that everyone really cares but you know when things don't necessarily go as intended um it's really hard then to unpack it and to understand what we could have done differently and I think at some point that was preventing us from getting better and better and better. So what we wanted to do by embracing um a product centric operating model was we wanted to do three key things that would um you know help us across the whole organization. We wanted to have a high degree of measurability. Essentially breaking down all the business outcomes into very very product specific deliverables, measuring, you know, testing, um, and knowing where things were working, where there were not working, which we couldn't up to that point. Um, we wanted to build truly crossf functional teams. Um, which I think sounds relatively easy. And then I will tell you why we found it. um not that easy in in real essence. Um but we obviously wanted to uh make sure that the teams were created in a way so there was a strong representation of um obviously engineering product UX but also product marketing. We started discussing the role of product marketing at that point and we never had the product marketing function for example or analysts embedded in the team for example the an um the data analy uh analysis department was separate and maybe maybe in some of the companies that that they work for as well they tend to do a lot of reporting for senior levels as opposed to serving you know the product teams and and we were at that point where we wanted to unlock that power really. Um, and we wanted to really create clear accountabilities. Um, being really clear, not conflating the role of a product manager, of a business owner, a product person. And that took us, um, a long time to unpack because again, as you can imagine, it's so easy to conflate the value of the role with the value of the person. Um and and that becomes usually a bit quite defensive conversation and and not a very straightforward one when you when you start um you know addressing the accountability piece. Um in any case so after the the senior leadership team got on board with it and I and every time I talk about this sounds like it was a talk or a series of talk and instead it was a very long time um months probably was maybe a year and a half like it was a long time it took me if I look back all I was doing at the very beginning as my um assignment as a CPO was talking to everyone in the board and trying to convince them that that was absolutely a good idea. Um, and it took me it took me a long time to be perfectly candid. Um but when when we got the senior leadership team on board then finally and I'll never forget that day when we got the go ahead to start running a a more specific trial very hands-on trial on um an a test and a trial on what that was meaning to become uh you know embracing these product uh principles. Um so what did we do? we uh and well sorry when I say we it was I would say largely the leadership team even though um lately I will tell you maybe a bit more about those dynamics but um I care really to say that there was a true alliance between myself as a CPO and the CTO um and and I'm mentioning this because I don't know whether it happens in all the companies obviously there was a healthy tension between our two roles like obviously me still pushing for features and um the CTO still pushing for uh quality of the code, the integrity of the code etc. Um but at least we had the same vision. We knew that we wanted the same thing uh for the company. Um and that is for example one thing that or an area where I might suggest you to look at in case you are in that position where you would like to do more and potentially creating an alliance with um the engineering team is something that definitely worked uh for us as a team and for me personally uh in that role. Um so we we got the go-ahhead to build a superstar cross functional team. We curated the team. We selected the best uh talent. We put them together. Super excited. Off we go. And we also had the moment where we had to decide um what to where to direct this superstar uh cross functional team. Where do we what do we ask them to solve? Um and obviously we were um we considered putting them on an area of the business with some level of impact but low risk. And in the end, we reconsidered that and we decided that we wanted to put them on the the most risky product we had at the time because we wanted to really create accountability, sense of ownership and we wanted to have skin in the game. Uh so that that could really work so that everyone had got the would have the impetus and and the energy behind to really make it work. Um so we picked mobile contracts and gift cuff contracts are have been out for a few years now but at the time the year in which we ran this um trial they were new. They hadn't been launched yet and they were actually the product that was making the difference between growing or staying flat. And if we had, you know, hadn't been able to launch them at the right time, we would have completely missed the target just to like the overall company target in terms of activations and revenue. So just to give you an idea of how crucial it was to get contracts, right? So before a big launch or just a few months ahead of big launch, we decided also to use um that product to forge new ways of working. We thought okay we are so scared about this that it must be the good the right thing because it's either make it or break it and it's going to work because you know we have thought about it. We thought about everything. We're so clear this is going to work. We have a clear vision. We've done all the ground work. it's going to work. Obviously, guess what? You know, in the typical manual of the product man manager, when you're so sure, you've done all your research, you're so sure that that feature will make such a big difference, it doesn't. And the trial didn't work or didn't work to the extent we wanted to. Um but at least gave us some reflection points and and clearly we gathered tons of feedback. Um so we learned we learned a lot and hopefully this is helpful for you too to just be you know playing it back honestly I think um could help you think it through as well. Um so we were so focused and we're sort of so we were so excited to build that crossf functional team that we didn't think through clearly the relationship of that team with the rest of the organization or at least not well enough. Um, and we noticed and probably would would have been very hard to anticipate this, but that there were key influencers outside of the team uh in the company that weren't completely on board and people could perceive their own um doubt about it. And I think that was casting a bit of a shadow on the overall ability of the product team to really do their job really well. Um, in terms of talent, um, I really needed the product management team to step up really quickly, uh, to own a P&L, um, very well and and they were absolutely ready. Um, but I think then doing it um, so suddenly and without maybe enough support and with a lot of pressure is something that they found uh, really really hard. Um and again it's something that I probably have underestimated the most uh as a CPO. Um how much support actually people need throughout um any change. Um data is something so we for example embedded a data analyst but again we realize that it's not enough to have a person over there that will feed data. they because they just fall back to different you know um traditional ways of doing things and they just do it in a way that is not um perfect. they they they would feed data but they wouldn't for example analyze it um in the right way so that it's ready for product teams and product teams were not also very accustomed to ask for the data they needed in the right way and so that felt very clunky as a relationship. Um and last but not least, again in a very unfiltered way, we had to um you know just surrender to the fact that the CPO and the CTO were two strong voices on wanting that vision, seeing that vision, pushing for it. Um and and we hadn't managed yet to cascade it down um deeply in the organization. um meaning that you know if you took the two of us away then everything would have fallen apart. Um and so the um we had to we were under pressure at that point to make sure that ways you know the ways of working were taken on by by someone else and not just by the two of us who couldn't be in the details u all the time. So the CTO and I went kind of back to the drawing board thinking we know this is right. We know we can make it work. How do we try again? um we went to the board the you know the drawing board and we thought okay so let's go back to the original brief which wasn't actually how do you transform the company or how do you uh make sure that the company works by the book with productled principles and we thought about it in a again in a slightly different way which was we need to build the strongest product organization we can build not for our own sake but for everyone's sake and primarily also for the benefit of our members. And yes, we love P&L accountability, data, UX and testing, experimenting. Fair enough. But what does it take then to get to that point? Um and so we had a even more honest conversation around well what we need to to change are really we need to reook at processes operations we need to look at how we are feeding data how we are reporting um all the tools for uh the dev team uh the tech stack we still had a level of leg legacy that we knew we knew was um you know making us lag behind slightly on on this on moving forward with this vision and we had to take a good look at talent density, commerciality of the product teams. Um and we knew that at that point that we had to do it with inspiration and engagement rather than you know jumping on wanting to do stuff and executing stuff and just applying those principles. So big learning and so I'll tell you fast forward what instead worked uh for us. Um and the first one that I if I'm really honest I refused to accept for a very long time was that I really or we really needed the sponsorship of our CEO which was actually obviously behind it was supportive of of of the whole um shift towards a product operating model. Uh but that was kind of happening closed doors and so it was when um we decided actually to make that really evident public. We relooked at the whole comms coming from the leadership team. All the events uh were at that point focused on the product organization of the future so that the people could find their own place in it. And it wasn't coming anymore just from the CPO but was actually coming from the whole board including the CEO that was taking a strong um stance on it as the this is where we're going as a company. Um and and there will be another I'll tell you in a second why this was so key. Um, another thing and and this I could talk to you about company OKRs and our journey for another 10 sessions, but in a in a nutshell, we started using OKRs and actually our journey on OKR OKRs has started a few years before. Um, but we used we use the framework of OKRs really to our own benefit. We boil it down to four objectives as a company. literally four and one of which at the time was for example launching broadband. So very concrete stuff that we wanted to do um as a company. Um and then we started cascading down those four objectives into um product objectives and we tried to make it as as concrete as possible. Why this was so key and maybe it's not key in all the the the new you know startups or startups that start right now but for us we actually were starting from literally marketing objectives, finance objectives, um product objectives and we were so fragmented that this was a huge undertaking first of all but second was also super successful because product, marketing, sales, finance, um engineering everyone had four object objectives and those four objectives were the same for the whole company. So this was a gamecher for us and you might remember that I told you about you know my role as a CPO the role of a CTO and that there were some influencers in the company. We realized that actually we just had to engage those people um and to make them the you know the evangelist of um this shift uh towards becoming a product organization of the future. Um we basically created essentially a squad of these um senior people that were really acting as um the glue between the senior leadership team and the product teams. Um and we engaged them. We we spent a lot of time together. Um we gave them strategic guidance and we gave them the mandate to take this forward as they envisioned it as they felt it was right and they had a lot of autonomy in executing and and delivering against it. Um and also product talent and I'm mentioning uh this and I'm stressing this because again my something I've haven't read actually in any book something that h has happened for us at GIFA the moment we started to talk about this with a lot more passion uh vision futuristic like people started to feel really excited about it and started to worry a bit less about themselves in um in protecting potentially their own role and we started seeing people were raising hands and say well I want to be part of this I want to move to product how can I do that and and that's how we started to build real talent by acquiring people from other teams like really really talented leaders that wanted really passionately to contribute towards it maybe less um skilled from um hardcore product management skills but great influencers great communicators, great leaders and people that really wanted to move forward with this. Um, obviously this also saved us quite a lot of money because it was a way for us to shift budget between one department and the other very effectively. Um and finally something that made a big difference was also the budgeting process. And with no disrespect whatsoever for my colleagues from finance, but you know how the budgeting process happens like there's a lot of assumptions on a spreadsheet. Um, and most of the time those assumptions actually never see the light or they don't see the light um, in the way that they're put in on a spreadsheet. Um and so what we did we really we had to fight for this but we succeeded was and thank thanks to the sponsorship of the CEO as well when when we were going through this change we decided to submit a budget um according to which we know we knew that we could achieve kind of 80% of of those targets but we we're not entirely sure and there wasn't 20% % of which was underpinned. Um, and we still decided to go ahead submitting a bigger number calling out specifically to the shareholders and the investors that that 20% was underpinned. Meaning that the product teams had really had to find a way throughout the year to cover that 20% of budget that we committed to. And as you can imagine, this is not something that you can go ahead with without the sponsorship of a CEO that takes that responsibility on themselves. Um, and again, this made a huge difference because it made the product teams um a lot more accountable uh for the P&L um in um and they really gave us a really strong signal also within the organization that they were owning uh the P&L. last um last slide and then because they're probably also bored of my voice. Uh but what did I learn uh out of all of this that actually is a journey of a few years so not pretty not short um change I think at least unless you know maybe works in other companies differently but for me what I really uh experienced firsthand that is change must be driven from the top. So you can get um further a bit further by yourself as a product person um but it needs to come from the top. You can influence pe more senior people but you need to have their sponsorship and endorsement to really make it work. It's a profound profound company and cultural change. If you really want to make it happen and especially if you set a really high bar and you want to tell yourself in your own heart and not on your CV that you've done it, it means that you have engaged the whole company across all the departments. Um and and I think the support you give to them is kind of never enough. there's so much help and support that they need to be able to go through uh the change. Uh talent in my opinion really makes it or break it. Um so you could find different ways to upskill your team. Um you know maybe moving people around, identifying key people that can help you. Um but talent is essential. So I if you don't have uh talent in key roles in product, in engineering, in UX, I think it's barely impossible to move towards to this model. Um and data governance process things that maybe as a PM we find a bit less fun. Um they are essential they they have to be rebuilt completely with a strong focus. Uh we rebuilt completely the governance how we were doing Siri meetings, board meetings, company meetings. Um a bit pedantic and not m not not not much not sorry not much fun. Uh essential though essential and again send such a strong signal. Um and trials as again you know buy the book of the great product manager. They're so essential. Um be open to the fact that might disprove your assumption. Definitely I didn't I hadn't didn't have some you know I had some sleep sleepless nights when um when the trial didn't go as intended or at least as I wanted it. Um but I think your resilience in overcoming um you know those shortcomings and keep trying and keep learning and getting better and better at it is absolutely is what makes um the biggest different difference in um moving forward with a product centric vision and um reapproaching the whole operating model on the basis of product and I think we're at the Thank you so much, Kata. Um, I know I've got some some questions. I'm sure everyone else uh does as well. I already seen a couple pop up in the uh in the chat. Um, thank you. Thank you so much for that. If you if you do have questions then then do write them in the chat and I'll um uh do my best to sort of like facilitate them. Um ju just just from my end like you know you're talking about um you know helping the product team here evolve and become much more more productled like can you give us a sense of the the scale of the challenge like how big was the organization how long did this take and what what did the ways of working look like kind of before and after? >> Yeah. Um so more or less uh it's a com it's a midsize company. it's 250 300 peopleish half of which um are product and tech and UX and so that was for example another big driver for us um in terms of you know thinking about the future of the engagement of product people um engineering team you know when you put two and two and say this is so essential half of the company is made by essentially product team so we are already a product company we we We we just have to behave um as one. Uh we we just need to improve I suppose the craft and cut it out for what it is because our future clearly looks like that. Um so for example my team was a team of 60ish people uh between product UX uh content um and and like I said I don't think so numerically we were outnumbering I think the rest of um the department but but and I suppose this happened in in so many other companies um where um that that started in a more traditional way where um you know there is a business case that becomes really successful. You start launching a product which is successful with a great marketing spin um then a lot of the um gravitas influence was still held by finance and marketing. Uh and again saying this with no disrespect my uh colleagues we talked so much about it um but I think there was a power dynamic that we had to rebalance um within the organization. How long did it take? Um well I did it for about five years. So not short period of time and from what my colleagues tell me is that they're still working on that vision. Uh so the vision is the same sorry more precisely the vision stayed so that's what the company is still working on um and they keep applying this principles to more and more products. So for example um if you are members or um you have heard about GEFKA so broadband was um launched under absolutely under these principles um roaming offering this summer under the same principles but I think the real struggle is when um you know there's always a like a a piece of legacy so it's easier to set things up in the way you in intend them and in a product way um the big chunk of um conversation still I'm assuming now is on you know the mobile side of things because it was set up just in a very different way and because it still represents majority of the P&L so it feels risky you know to change stuff there >> yeah super thanks very much um we've we've got a couple of questions in the chat why don't I um read them out and so you don't have to go digging for them so uh first question from DPN uh who's asking you know a world-class product organization needs to manage its cash cow optimizing its core offering while simultaneously building for the next wave of growth. What's your advice to protect and empower the exploration teams working on newer riskier bets and the inevitable pressure to de resources back to the immediate high certainty wins of the core mobile business. >> Yeah. Yeah. And I think this is exactly what I was referring to now, which was much easier to do it when you launch broadband and roaming and there's no legacy, much harder when yeah, majority of your P&L is driven by mobile and and it was working in a completely different way. Um, we're also quite frankly, you know, a lot of the tweaks are kind of commercial tweaks that you can make. So um either you're a very very commercially sound product manager or it's easier for it's quite easy for a finance person to come in and say oh I would do this I would do that. Uh and there's a it's much harder to protect that. Um but then your next question um is about what do you advise to protect and empower the exploration teams? So yes uh yes um we have been through this so many times I can't tell you um I can tell you what we did so we went through a few times um a resourcing exercise which we did between CPO and CTO and actually one good thing that I could mention again is that before we use I would used to think about my budget as product budget and this and the CTO budget as his while instead what we started doing was no no listen we have a common vision if you need budget I will give you budget and we will just work it through. Um so I think this is this is a great thing for example um that I I think I could mention as well to substantiate the power um of um all like having an alliance and in this case was the CTO where we would you know wouldn't ask for more money but we would just be shifting stuff around in case I needed something uh because we agreed that you know having a stronger UX person or a stronger PM would help both of us and and therefore the whole organization. Um but um basically every week we were asked oh we don't think this this team delivers enough. Why don't we put a couple of engineers over here in mobile so that if we put them on mobile then they can deliver this bunch of features um and we can make money out of it. Um I don't know if I have got the answer but then I think you really need to be you need to be standing your ground. You know you need to remind people that you know it's not just you move a couple of devs and therefore they write this amount of code and therefore this equates more money. It doesn't work that way. There are so many reasons why it doesn't because the developers you know are people. they they they this know a specific domain. They they are used to work in a specific team. Um and they're not just re people that resources that you can shift around forgetting that they are um you know human beings. Um, and also I think um maybe in a bit of a cheeky way, but I remember going back and saying, "Well, we thought, so you think this could be a great business case, and I hear you, but you also thought the same about this other thing. We did it. I followed you that time. It didn't really work. So we we will never have the proof that this great business case is actually sure money." And so here we're taking the risk as a team. We we I tried always to bring people back to the vision we signed up to. Um I can't say I was very popular at the time or that it wasn't uh easy, but honestly I don't see any other way than holding your ground and not being pulling being pulled in each and every direction. I always try to be really logical, open and yeah collaborative trying to support everyone. um because in the end the goal is not um the you know the the product setup is actually being successful as a company and generating growth but if I wasn't sure about the value of some stuff I would just call it out and most of the time I think that was the case. Yeah, super that question. It's it's not always easy to un unpack all that happened. Uh >> yeah, >> there's a couple of questions here which I I I feel are quite related. So again is is sort of asking how did you bring a shared understanding of you know sort of true product management um to the the the leadership level um and sort of explain what that looked like to them. Um and then Sud is asking sort of what did the training look like for nontechnical folks um when you wanted to get them you know thinking in a more in a more productlike way. >> Yeah. So um leadership team it was a lot of conversations and I tried so many different ways. I don't know what really could work for you. I think try different things and see what sticks um depending on your personality type the the other people's personality type the comp the type of company culture I tried um oneto ones so for example talking you know on a one-toone basis um about what that was um looking like and listening to their own concerns um was really powerful for me didn't change things in the short term but for example being told by the CMO quite frankly I love the vision but I'm not yet sure that we have enough um talent or the caliber of people that we might need in the organization was just very good feedback painful because you can you cannot act upon it um overnight uh but at least I knew where the concern uh was um and I thought actually was a also relatively val you know valid concern but I also uh did a lot of workshops with the leadership team uh in um you know obviously with the sponsorship of the CEO but trying to work things out together um to understand just asking 10 million questions like what do you mean what what concerns you what why do you think it's not this way um it was a long long process but eventually uh we got there um so I would say you I think your best chance of succeeding is listening to everyone one's concern even though you know what you have to do from the first moment and I think that make what makes the process difficult at the personal level because you know you could be doing tomorrow if they only listen to you but then it's your job to listen to their own concerns as well. >> Yeah. >> Um there was oh in product in terms of product uh was that the training of people outside product? Yeah. >> Yeah. Exactly. Um well at some point we hired the product coach. It worked. It helped massively. Um because as well again being really candid and honest um no matter how much I tried not to put my you know attach my name to that vision, I was still carrying the um the job title of chief product officer. And so product was in my job title. and in a way or the other I think it was still coming across as I wanted to push for my own agenda. Um and and in the end I think having also a product coach that people could go back to and say well how did you do this in this company or the other company and kind of having a bit of an external um opinion I mean someone that obviously then was absolutely part of the company but I think that uh really helped um in terms of training um well there is Ed now right? Um no but generally I think the the gift cuff still loves absolutely all all the things that you uh the hassle budger does. Um but there are more and less effective uh trainings to be really honest and I don't think many actually um cater for the understanding of u people outside product. Um, one good thing that I think I did at some point I forced everyone in the leadership team to read the transformed. They loved it. They understood somehow much better what I meant um for a long time. Um, and things started to shift. So sometimes I think again maybe finding clever ways to propose external content that comes across as unbiased as much as possible objective really helps as well and um keep being generous with feeding um that content that inspiration but equally I suppose it's also important to to try to maybe find resources that would play devil's advocate right like to show how hard it can be um for the teams around product um to adjust to that change and um I think that um yeah that goes a long way in in in building bridges um and trying to understand each other. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. Super. Um and one more question here from Felipe who's uh lead product ops at Zenef and um he's wondering how do you think prepare for and structure your organization for the future? So speaking in terms of the product and team growth but also the evolution of uh productled growth in the company >> I'm not sure I fully understand. So, how did they structure the company? Um, >> so my my reading of this question is he's thinking about how do you um how do you plot out the kind of like just number of people you you'll have the structure of the teams that kind of like that future org chart and then how do you kind of like move from one to the the next? >> Okay. Okay. Thanks. Um I'll answer Philippe but if you want more clarification then jump in. So we had the big constraint which was budget. So we knew you know we had I can't remember exactly the number let's say 250 people the the product organization of the p future needed to have 250 people. So that is a big constraint uh in the end um and so what we really did well we were lucky that we had a bunch of vacancies at the time. So changing the job title between dev and product manager or UX didn't didn't have really an impact on people. So we started from there playing around literally with the numbers and then um we engaged the head of engineering or the heads of engineering and the product directors basically put ourselves for hours and hours if not days in front of a big spreadsheet thinking okay maybe how do we resource the GIFA product broadband team? How do we resource this team? We tried and we noticed that you know first draft you need still 100% more budget and people okay second cut 80% and and then it got to a point where okay this feels a bit stretchy and a bit uncomfortable but you know we are kind of three we we could really do more with three people or something like that and then the conversation began oh you know maybe we have three vacancies in marketing in sales can we do that and and we kind of tried to do as much as possible between product and tech to try to avoid to piss the everyone else off. Um and then we started thinking as well, oh what if we shift maybe we propose to this person to come over here and maybe that would be a really good product person and um and we we we just spend a lot of time trying this out first from yeah this is what we would love and then going backwards slowly slowly a bit painfully I was like I don't really want to um compromise in is I really have to um and and I think that real strong reality check really worked because then we went forward with a proposal of you know um opex line stays flat we're just rejigging a few things we think it can work and off we go we went ahead with it um now obviously I would also say though that we had we felt the need of reassessing it every year and we had a bit of a tendency every year of kind redoing it. That I think was maybe our weak weakness in a way. Maybe we we should have given it a longer uh longer life potentially to make it really succeed. Um maybe that that's a reflection point that comes to my mind now. >> Super. Thanks very much. Oh, I think we do have one more question. Uh I think this will probably be the last question we we'll take just given an eye on the time. Um from Lily um who says, "I noticed a common trap for companies in similar situations is that they know that their old ways are not working anymore. Um they want to change fast but feel operating models are too rigid and take away control of established power structures. How do you ease them into an open learning mindset?" >> That is that is the question, isn't it, Lily? Um I think it it takes time. It takes time. Um I think it's about again about conversations. If you if you know that that is important then um again we tried different ways. We tried trials. We tried training. I think it's again applying a bit more that product mindset of you know well let's just test a bunch of stuff and learn uh from it. I think the challenge is when you have to do it obviously at the scale of the whole organization then you just might need the actual buyin from other departments and I think that's when things get fairly tricky. Um I would also say that Gift was always a culture where we were fairly open. We wanted to learn a lot. So maybe we had more fertile ground. We were not that traditional. Um we were quite traditional in sense of kind of having departments I would say. Um but the in my case I think that everyone wanted to learn and wanted to be open. it is just much harder when you do it um on something that people feel very close or or very yeah very defensive about it. So I don't know if I'm actually answering your question Lily but um I think it's a difficult one. I think it what all of this journey was really about how every day you show up you continue to show up a challenge after challenge and you try to make people com more comfortable. I think you it's the only only thing I did for five years. >> Super. Well, Colosa, thank you so much for coming along and chatting with us um this evening.
