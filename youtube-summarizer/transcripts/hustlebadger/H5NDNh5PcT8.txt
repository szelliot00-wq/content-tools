Welcome everyone. I am Ed. I'm the co-founder of Hustlebadger. Um we are delighted to have Fabris with us today. Um Fabris is a you know serial entrepreneur who's had two successful exits. Um he's a renowned product speaker and is here to talk to us about how to manage um you know product bets, products investments. Um I guess but I'll let him I'll let him say more. Um whilst he's chatting I will you know do my best to facilitate the uh the chat and if you have questions then you know make sure they're passed on. >> Okay. Wonderful. So but actually uh it seems like I cannot share my screen. He say it's in pose. I don't know if you need to allow me to do anything. Ed >> let me just check see what what I can do. >> Yeah in the meantime. So yeah, as Ed said, I an entrepreneur. I started my career as an entrepreneur in 2002. Uh, and spare the rest of my professional life as an employee. So used to be the CPO of the fork, which is one of the three brands of the trip focused on restaurants. So that would be the European Open Sable if you know Open Sable and work in other companies like Dieser, which is a French music streaming company. So let's say the French Spotify uh and IBM a long time ago. Uh and I was actually the first product marketing manager in France in 2007 which mean that either I was a visionary or it was a very very bad carry choice. Uh it took us 15 years to actually have the product marketing management function be something uh in France. So, we got to talk about money. Um, and um, not only because the only goal of a product is to generate money. Um, because there's a mission behind that, right? But if you want to go on plane, you need some fuel. And let's face the fact that even if you're for example working as public service, you still need to show to someone that you actually are creating an impact that will justify the fact that they need to give you money every year. That the same thing if you are an NGO and could be the same thing if you're an impact driven company. So let's see again. Yeah, I'm afraid as far as I can see, all the settings are already set up, but I can share your slides for you if you're having um trouble sharing. >> Yeah, I would try to do another thing, right? I could maybe just zoom doing Zoom things. >> Yeah, now it's working. Wonderful. >> Great. Um so I want to start with something which might be a bit depressing to everyone but will in way product has failed right uh and don't say that because of GI or because of whatever it failed because of ourselves if you go back to what we were supposed to do what was the core promise of the product function it was to transform technology from the center of cost to a center of profits you might have seen that promise numerous times on slides during whatever conferences you went to. That's wonderful on paper and this justifies why we don't want to be a feactory etc etc etc. And the thing is that yeah it makes a lot of sense and we've had plenty of years to actually show that we could generate profits. The problem was that for a long time we didn't have to justify anything, right? Because money was free. That was the zer era, right? So instead of using all that time and money to generate profits, what we did is that we generated plenty of frameworks, so many frameworks. Actually, I stumbled upon a a quadruple or quintuple diamond the other day looking for some stupid frameworks or people just building frameworks on top of other frameworks and we had end up not creating money driving uh products. We started doing something which is called products planning. So just like men's planning but about products we felt that our role was actually to educate the others right so no I don't care that about your question about when this feature will actually be in production you need to understand discovery and delivery and points and estimations because if you don't understand that we can't talk we can't have a proper conversation you're not product smart enough and it made us really look like aos let's say that but still it was okay we had plenty of money and we could just show road map to investors that we receive more money and then 2002 happened the vadaava of the product world we had to prove profitability so plenty of us we discovered that our job was actually to generate enough money enough fuel to go on playing the product game and the thing But definitely it made us look like this right. We had plenty of frameworks talking about userdriven whatever centric but at the end we were not proving that investing in the product was just worth it. Building another team was just worth it. We were not connected at all with the PN of the company. We were actually a cost sensor and people consider us like this. The good thing is that it's not a fatality. Um, and actually one of the greatest thinkers of the 20th century and even of the 21st century can inspire us to try to redefine our role in the organization. And do you think Jean Clude var because well Jeancl know everything about impact right uh we always talk about being impact driven creating impact when it comes to product management and product engineering but he knows all about impact he knows so much about impact that he actually went beyond impact he created the double impact because that's Jean Clude right and actually that's a real ad for Volvo trucks. You can find the video online. That's wonderful. It really did it. It was not made with AI at all. And it can inspire us a rule of a product which is the double impact low. The fact that a product exist to generate ROI for the user and ROI for the company at the same time. Right? So just state like that. It might seem a bit obvious but so many of us just forgot that part. the fact that we need to prove both arise at the same time. How many business people talk only about the company AI without thinking of what's in it for a user or a customer? At the other end of the spectrum, you might have plenty of people, especially designers, focusing on the user, saying, "Yeah, that's good for the user, right? But will the user pay for that?" So the goal of product management is actually to prove to justify this double AI this double impact whenever we decide to put our time on something. So let's just deep dive on three principles. the three principles. It's not it's not a framework, right? Uh but I'd like to show how it helped me as a CPO and help my customers, my PMs, my engineers think differently about their role and try to adapt their artifact just like a road map for example in the right way. So let's deep dive on three principle. The first one is co-investments. The fact that actually we are all in the same boat, right? The second is capping. The fact that you don't write a plain check whenever you take a decision in product and the third one is the portfolio. You don't put all your eggs in the same basket. So I just translate magnitude into a boomer language. So if you need to talk to your boss tomorrow or to your mother during the weekend, you can actually give an explanation that she can understand. So let's deep dive on the first one co-investments. Well, if you remember what I've said just at the beginning, the fact that the promise of product was to transform technology from center of cost to center of profits. What do that actually mean concretely as a team? Well, the goal of that team is to transform the time of the team into impact, right? You have one year to build something. If you have OKRs and not cars at the same time, you have a full year. And actually, a lot of us don't understand what this time represents. This time represents money, a lot of money. So what people used to say was that one year of the team is one million per year put dollars, euros, pounds, whatever. That just a way to understand it, right? That's the ballpark that we have. >> 1 million per year is actually a lot of money. So the goal is start say yeah I have a road map. I have a backlog. is that as a CPO and as a company you're given if you're a product manager or product engineer product designer whatever 1 million to invest. So where are you going to put that money and what are you going to promise as a return and this is the first step in thinking in terms double impact. So whenever for example you take the decision to add an extra week to something you are actually putting 20k on the table. So an extra week because you think it's better technically or because you think that you should do the extra mile on the design side it's 20k. So it might not seem that expensive but it means that's 20k less for something else. So every time that you take this kind of decision, every time that you have a sprint planning, if you're working in two week sprints um in scrum for example, it means that every Monday you're taking a decision of investing 40k on your product. 40k of money without any return right now. So it's not a question of impact, it's a question of a what are you going to do to transform that million into something else which would be product and business KPIs and at the end money to keep on playing. So that's a different posture in a way and a different responsibility that we need to take. So we need to act like investors. We are giving 1 million to invest. We need to show right at the beginning of the year what would be the potential impact of our team so that we justify what we are actually uh burning as money right just like a startup in a way and at the end of the year you need to prove that you have the impact that you had in mind else you may just get fired and in a way that's the game but I'd say co-investment not just investment Because we are not alone and that's the problem. If we start talking in a money language, right? That's okay. That's wonderful. Everybody should actually speak in the money language in a company. But the thing is that our stakeholders never had to. So we need to change what our stakeholders are doing and how they behave with us. And that might be the hardest part. So let's take a stupid scenario that has no link whatsoever with reality, right? Let's take a scenario when you have someone in the company, let's say uh a sales guy if you're in B2B or a marketing girl if you're in in a B2C and they actually want something on the road map. They have plenty of reasons to do so and especially they were asked to push for initiatives while doing the OKR thing. They have their own objectives, right? So well, you cannot just say face to face to the sales guy or the marketing girl that their idea is stupid, right? Even if you think it's stupid, you still need to take that to consideration and take some time looking at the date uh giving one kind of an official answer to that. And the thing is that this time is money. We've said that. So you're investing money in doing that. What is the cost for the guy or the girl who is actually asking something on the road map? Well, zero. It cost them nothing to just add something in the backlog. Absolutely nothing. And even though there are 100 items for you to take a look at, they would just add another one. The cost is absolutely zero. Now, let's imagine that you've been pressured to accept that and put that on the road map. whenever linked with the reality is of course completely fortress. So what you're going to do is you do the discovery phase and take a look at things and of course spec it design it and do it and test it, put that to production and measure it. That's your job. It's 20K per week, right? So imagine that it takes you five weeks to do that. It's 100K that you've invested. What is the cost for the guy or the girl who asked that specific feature to be on the road map? Absolutely zero. So you've been pushed to put 100k on the table and they put nips 0K. Now imagine that at the end of the year may your CPO have a conversation with you and we take a look at the investment that you've made during the year and this investment actually had absolutely no return. We never sold that to a customer. The customer chose someone else. And the thing is that well I'm going to say you've just burned 100k for nothing. You haven't done your job if you haven't compensated with other investments. Right? And you still have to maintain it or to kill it and add just an extra cost now. The thing is that what is the consequence for the marketing girl or the sales guy? Absolutely nothing. Nips. So in a way you've invested money for them. It didn't work out. They could just go on asking a new thing. no consequences whatsoever. So it's not problem of honesty is the fact is that for years the sales and the marketing and the operation etc they would just consider our budget as free to use completely free because there were no consequences so whenever we would go on talking about investment they say yeah yeah I don't care I just want a road map right and if it doesn't work it's not a big problem so we need to turn them into co-investors because we need them to have what we call skin in a game. So the skin in the game is a f know if everyone knows it. It's a chicken going to talk to a pig and then the chicken say hey lads I have eggs and bacon this morning and the pig will answer well that's easy for you. You produce one egg per day. It's not even a part of you. Well for me bacon well a little bit more involvement right. Well, they need to have something to lose. So, first, no business cases because, well, I'm going to be honest. I've never seen a honest business case in my entire life. Even the ones that actually I was producing were not completely honest. Um, so we need to start with whatever we do when we invest, which is a pitch. And the pitch should be something which is pushed very very early on without having three months of meetings in the marketing department when it's so refined that you're going to say no to something and people have invested a little bit of time on that especially their credibility in the company and then they need to show of course data but the first thing would be for me giving access to users and customers. I've seen too many teams struggling with the fact that they couldn't talk with users or customers for whatever reason of protecting the sales or the branding relationship whatever. Well, that's not acceptable because it means that you cannot see if the investment is worth it. So, they need to take a risk here. They need to consider that if you're taking a risk of using 100k of your budget, they should at least give you access to those customers. The second thing is time. Well, if you need to talk to customers, right, to understand their needs, you don't really need the sales guy with you. But if you start pitching the value, trying to see would actually people pay for that. Well, personally, I'm a former CPO. I'm not a sales guy and the sales guy will always be better than me at detecting weak signals of people trying to please you but that will actually never close the deal. So they need to come. It needs to be integrated in their own objectives. And then all the goto market parts whenever you have one sales guy pushing for something well first thing you need to check if that's going to be interesting for the others. For example, if that's someone in Spain, he needs at least to talk to people in Germany to make sure that there's something for them too. And then he needs to motivate the other sellers say this is why it's interesting to sell and they need to work on the sales enablements. And at the end they need to show what will be a realistic target. What signals can we measure after release that will show that this is a success commercially? So let's take a look at the pipeline. How many of our current customers could actually be interested? Can we call them right beforehand because we don't want to put money on something which is not a little bit solid right so I don't want something in production in 3 months without having the machine to distribute it. So in a way you're just taking a risk putting money on the table just like you do you put your time as a product team they put their network they put their knowledge and they put actually their heads when it comes to committing to something that should actually be a signal of success or failure. So this is really the logic of co-investments and really starts thinking about the relationship that you have with stakeholders in a different way. Now let's go on the capping part. The capping part is related to that. I've just said that one week is 20k. So you just have €1 million to invest. You cannot have more. It's in a way the cash that you have on your account, right? It's your runway if you're a startup. So whenever you take the decision to put money on something, still as I said, it's money you cannot put on another thing. You will have to do sacrifices and this is why you want to cap your investments. Capping it goes with appetite and ambition. So if you read the shaper book, it might remind you of something but it was here before uh the shaper part is really linked to investment. The appetite is what percentage of the budget do you want to put on that specific investment. It's not only 20 or 40k because doesn't mean anything. The goal is to say well which part of my million euro million dollars do I actually want to put on that? how how worth it in a way it's considering the ambition. So if you commented for example on reducing the churn for I don't know 25 to 20% at the end of the year you need to compare the ROI of any potential investments on that baseline. And so it's not about 40k, it's 40k for what? Even though it's just an approximation of the impact that you have. It's the first way of looking at things and as an investor, right? And this capping thing will actually apply to everything that you do. So of course to our own investments, but to the activities of the product team too. So discovery for example, the biggest problem that we have with discovery is teams spending potentially months on discovering things, doing the quadruple diamond, triple loots, discovery, whatever. The thing is that discovery is due diligence. Basically, you assess the risk that you might take by putting money or putting more money on an investment. So you need to cap it considering the level of risk that you have in front of you and the total appetite. So for example, if it's really really risky and you have a very low confidence, well, you might want to spend two weeks or three weeks on a six week investment just looking at the potential risk. But that's part of the deal, right? So that's really due diligence. Whatever test that actually doesn't fit in that time, you don't do it there and you just decide, do I want to go on with whatever I have on the table or do I just stop? So anyway, you just paying to see just like in poker, right? The second part is delivery. It's the most obvious one. It's what we call design to cost. So everybody has heard about the agile thing. You cannot fix the date and the perimeter at the same time, right? But here, just like the guys in shape up, you decide that it's going to be the date. You just it's a date because it's time and time is money. So, you don't commit on we're going to do all this. You commit on we're going to spend six weeks on that and do whatever we can in six weeks. Because if we in a way did a bad estimation of the appetite, well, it's on us, right? But if it takes 8 weeks and not 6 weeks, the LOI is lower than expected by definition. You spend 25% more on it. So at the end, the AOI is not good. So you don't don't want to put extra two weeks on something which has a bad because it's going to break your equation your economic equation at the end of the year. And the third part is the go to markets. It's one part that we tend not to really consider as product teams and that's a problem because as I said if you don't have the distribution machine you're going to end up with wonderful features that's never going to use and never going to be sold and roughly in average it's 50% of top of product cost and that's just an average if you're pure PG for example you might go down to 20 or 30%. And if you really have sales intensive really long things or going through partners and cycles that might be 9 months or 12 months or whatever, it's going to be maybe 150 or or or 200% of the product costs. So whenever you actually invest €1 million euros in average you don't invest€1 million euros you invest€ 1.5 million euros because you need that money from the go to market teams you need the sales and the marketing and the operation to actually put that money on the table to allow success. So that's a big responsibility. You need to make sure that you actually have co-investors. So it's just not giving lessons to the others, it's applying that to whatever we want to put on the road map as a product team. So for example, you might have one specific uh soft launch for example that might not be expensive on a go to market. If it's a hired launch, you definitely know that if you have to do a road show and you have to train your sellers and train the trainers and then the trainers need to train the customers, it's going to be expensive. So if you want to calculate rare y of what you do, you cannot just be blind on that part. So that's the capping. So you act like investors. You consider that people need to pitch you things and them saying you need to pitch your ideas to them, need to consider the risk to do an assessment, then say whatever link you have. So what is the appetite and the ambition etc etc etc. and everybody commits on the money. So it could be the time, the network and we say that on the table for that specific investment. Now the thing is that you need to compare the investments because well it's a road map right? You just not a list of whatever you could do. You need to make choices. That's why strategy exists. And in a way any strategy is an investment thesis. Let's take stupid examples with tickets and lops. So this is the list of whatever could go on your road map in 2026. Plenty of things going from plenty of people. And if you had to actually put that into buckets, envelopes, you would end up with lots of envelopes. Meaning that these envelope represent a percentage of your million euros. The problem is that well, too many envelopes means no focus, right? And the problem is when no focus, you don't have a lot of results. You might end up with having a social results. So the first thing that you do in a strategy and which is lacking from 95% of the strategies of my customers is defining what you're not going to do. That might seem stupid right and maybe you heard it uh reading good strategy bad strategy for example book but the first thing to say this doesn't mean anything they are not linked with the strategy and we decide not to do them. So it limits the percentage of investment that's going to be disconnected with the strategy or you just accept that you need to find 10% in develop of 10% on whatever things that are not linked with strategy which are purely demands from specific teams on compliance whatever that's okay but you cap it it's 10% not more than this if it actually goes beyond 10% it means that you are lowering the chances of success of you as a team reaching the target of the year. Now, so you end up with less tickets and less envelopes, but that's just the beginning, right? Um there's no rule in the universe that says that you should divide your million euros into three equal envelopes. You might choose based on for example KPI trees that there's one part of the product or one specific segment or one specific product in your portfolio that needs more investment because it should have better result on your yearly target. So you might define that these envelopes are bigger and then you choose to have one which will represent 45% of your budget. Why does that help? If you need to do investment, it helps because you're not going to compare all the investments. You're going to compare investment that makes sense on that specific envelope. So, you're going to compare this. So, you won't have a rice framework with a matrix with, I don't know, 1,000 lines and 30 columns trying to compare things and end up with stupid scorings that won't help you make a decision. You will end up with having a limited list of opportunities and you might have an envelope or only 450K, not more than this. that so you need to consider all these investments and you can compare the ones that are going to be the most promising ones. So the goal is not now to say no because your idea is stupid. Is to say well no because this is the size of the investment envelope and actually your investment pitch is less interesting than the others considering the result that is expected with that envelope. So you're talking in terms of money. You're not talking about show me your problem or give me your data. You're actually acting as a responsible professional considering that he or she has been given 1 million to invest in a full year and you created a system that will actually give the best chances of providing the value back to the company. You're just doing your job. And of course it might mean some tickets that you don't invest in and some tickets that might be bigger than the others because you have more appetite for them. That's the first part of a portfolio. It mean that you don't have a lot of eggs. So you need to actually target things quite wisely. The second part is that not all the eggs are the same. it doesn't actually they don't all give the same kind of fruits here. So let's take um one example of um looking at portfolio the AI potential on one side the risk or a certainty on the other side and just for the sake of the example let's imagine that it's your own money that you're investing you're never going to take 100% of your money I'm really say 100% and put all that into high-risk investments Right? You're going to put some part of your money on well your bank account um because you want something which is secure and still gives a little bit of results. That would be low hanging fruits or enablers. So as an example, rebranding a transactional email might not look like it has a lot of value. It is not going to break the bank, right? But still you know that you might have a small percentage of revolution here and well the fact that you deal with branding. So in one way you need to do it right. The second part would be things that are more balanced, more AOI potential but a little bit more risk, right? So that's going to be the strategic initiatives and you go from low mid risk to mid high risk. These are usually the ones that you put on your OKRs, right? And for a restaurant product that would be uh recommending by user intent trying to understand why people want to go to the restaurant because you have this situation that if you go for romantic dinner it might not be the same restaurant that you want to recommend as if you're going for a business lunch for example. So strategic initiatives and the N1 are the bets. And to be honest, I don't like people saying that everybody everything is a bet. It's not a bet. Bets are really things that are hard, right? Is things that are very um potential um actually let's say failures, right? You want to put money on something with a high risk, but if you don't do it, what's going to happen? That's the goal of a bet is that is that you're ready to lose that money, but you have this intuition that it could actually change the game. And if you don't do it and you just go on the low hanging and strategic initiatives might you might actually um don't get the next technological wave for example. Uh you're going to be disrupted, right? So the goal is to have a balanced portfolio. You need some lowhanging fruits because you need kind of a baseline, right? And you might need a lot of strategic initiatives because they are the ones that might have good impact and you need a little bit of a bet. And depending on your company, for example, prepf is a bet. Depending on your team, depending on um the market, this um repetition between those three types of investment might change. So you might choose to have only 10% of lowhanging fruits uh and 20% of bets. That's really up to you and up to your risk profile to be honest just like an investor. Um so that's why I don't say 25 60 or 10 just because it really is up to you. And there's just one investment missing here which is the depths. And the depth doesn't actually bring money to the door, but it covers a potential of loss. The depth has compound interest. So the idea behind the depth is not to say, well, because the tech guys decided that it should be 20%, we went on with 20%. You still need to put money behind that. So what will happen if we don't do that for a full year? If we don't touch that depth, this is really the goal of putting finance behind the depth. You might want to cover it though even it's an insurance you want to cover it because there's something bad that could happen. This is why you spend some security for example or you don't want new opportunities uh to actually be unaccessible. This is what we see today with a lot of teams that want to go full agentic and they end up saying well we haven't APIs our products and the documentation is not there and the data stack is actually not good and we don't know if we have the same definition of what a customer is uh in the different parts of the product. So that start to be a problem if you want to go aantic for example or that could be efficiency saying that the problem is with efficiency that we're losing money. So if you have a1 million euros but the depth is actually very expensive it means that you don't have that million euro you might have 800k because you're gating slower. So because one day of work is more expensive than what you thought. So in a way you're just limiting your ability to invest and this is where it starts to make sense comparing the investment in adept and investment in the rest of the product. Last thing is the difference between launch and lending. So we talked so far about considering pitches as investors, right? We talked about whatever people should commit on our time on our side plus networks and time and pitches and sales enablements on the other side. But definitely if you thinking as an investor you want to look in the review mirror in a way a road map cannot stop at release. And the thing is that a lot of teams today are looking at a road map and putting a release date and whenever it's in production they don't take a look where it lands. So imagine SpaceX launching a rocket and not looking where the rocket will actually land. It makes absolutely no sense. And that's actually what we do guys. So a road map cannot stop at release. And if you start tip at release, in a way you cannot complain that the rest of the company considers your road map as a release plan because if it blocks at release, it's actually a release plan. That's the definition of it. So if you want to take a look back in the review mirror looking at the results after one month, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, then you're just doing your job. You want to know what was the AOI of the different initiatives and if after one month and three months you don't see a signal on the market. Well, you need to take your investors in responsibility. They need to be there with you whenever you do a quarter review of the different investments. They need to explain why did not work or why they didn't actually put the money on the table that was promised. they didn't commit to talking about that specific feature. But that's really our responsibility as investors. We put money, we take a look back, we see how much we've burned so far, and then we take new decisions based on that. So this is what the now next later has always been about. It's never been about just uncertainty. It's always been about the uncertainty of results and how do we make new decisions because the um state of our portfolio has changed. The results show that they were better or worse than what we had in mind and then we take new investment decisions and this is how an investor should behave. now and I just for 30 seconds want to talk about GNI here. People have asked me is there something changing uh in terms of vari yes and no because those three circles these veins diagram that we've used extensively to do product explaining by the way are actually zones of risk. So well any product should be geni non ji driven is actually uh needs to actually respect the these these three criteria it's not optional right and the zones of risk we need to cover and this is whatever we do when we take about due diligence right we just need to assess level of risk of those three zones and try to prioritize the ones that should lower level of risk as long as it's kept Right? But the thing is that geni brings new risk on the table and there are plenty of new ones. But if you just consider it trust one be one of the biggest one. How do you actually create trust with a product that is by definition uh probabilistic? Are people okay to actually learn how um latency and error will change the perception of the value? Um what are the expectations? Um how do you actually manage to make money out of that? Um we seen the problematics of products like cursor or lovable that cannot have a price by seat but for years we've actually bought things by seat. So well how do you define the right price level in a situation when sometimes and that's the first time in history when as product people you always want your product to be used but with geni you might want it not to be used too much which is a very special way of mind right success metrics how do you define what is success so you have the eval part that might be for me the most um critical ical one for product people lately but it's not only about eval how do you even define the success of that feature business-wise and of course plenty of ones on the physibility part I'm not going to dive in on this so if you apply the three principles I'm not saying that you're going to make uh plenty of money but at least you will try to talk in the men language you will educate sorry for that word your co-investors to commit to things to say it's not against you but I'm surely I'm an investor so I will always consider the risk of failure and if you don't give me the elements well I cannot put all that money on this specific investment it's not possible so it's not about you it's about me having a target to reach so if you have those three principles Well, logically you have the possibility to reach the double impact. Thank you. Uh I guess there might be questions but I haven't seen the chat so I cannot say Ed getting back to you. >> Thank you Fabric. That was fantastic. Um yeah I really enjoyed that. Um I haven't seen any questions in the chat just yet. I do have one question myself. So maybe I'll ask that and uh if anyone has any questions they can drop your question in the chat while we're talking. You you firstly um I have to kind of point out to people that your LinkedIn handle is product ROI which is shows how dedicated to this this concept you are which I I love. Um my question though was you you talked a lot about co-investment. Um, do you do that um, explicitly with other leaders? You know, do you do some kind of, you know, give them tokens, ask them to bet on different initiatives, or is that something you how do you how do you get them to explicitly buy into the kind of the allocation you're you're making? >> Well, there are different ways of looking at it. Uh, I'm going to give you two examples. The first example is a B2C part of the fork and the other one is a B2B part of the fork because they are um it's it's a source enable marketplace. So you really have two different logics here. When it comes to B2B, we defined pillars of investment. We decided that we needed really three big envelopes on three very different topics and this will allow us on top to actually raise our top business KPI. So you always build let's say KPI trees or product metric trees but link that to the organization itself and then we created um investment committees. So the goal is not to have one very dull meeting when people take decision instead of product teams. The goal is really to make sure that we are as a board giving all the elements to the product teams to make the right decisions. So whatever the product team would say these are the things that have been pitched to me and and this is the things that we have in mind as a board and there would be country managers and myself and design director um how do you see things which kind of risk that I may be missing uh the Italian say well I think that might be interesting and you should talk to Alessandro for example in Milan and I think on the market that would be interesting. So the first thing is really this pitch thing saying okay let's take the decision altogether and then we commit as leaders to actually help the teams go on if they decide to invest in that direction. So we make sure as a group to say well we have the authority if for example we dedicated two people in the sales teams one in Germany one in Spain to work on that that they are not pushed to actually sacrifice that time for whatever objective that they have. So it needs to be fair right the sales guy should not lose money just for the sake of helping a product team and then we go on taking those decisions and all the country managers will go back to their teams and give just a score of is it interesting for me whatever Spain is proposing whatever the product team is proposing. So we we started doing some kind of road map thing as a board instead of having this dull thing when everybody would just shout to the product team say I want that on the road map or the Spanish girl wanting something for a market but not being conscious that it's not reusable for the others. So that was the first thing that we did on the B2C part. uh usually that was more marketing asking for things and then the decision that we made was to see where we could coin invest. So we divided the teams into part of the funnel that's way organizing it. I'm not saying it's the perfect one, but it made sense for us. And we decided considering the metrics that we had that it didn't mean anything to put money on um first time and second time and 10th time users. The big problem that we had was the first and second time users. We needed to get them to actually so go at least twice into a window of time and leave at least one rating or one review. And then we will see a correlation between this and their understanding of the product that it's just not Google booking but there's recommendation behind that and then people will return. So in a way our CA payback would be largely better. Um so we focused on that and that was a big decision and we all made and went on on on the OKRs by the way. So any investment that was pitched needed to have a link with that and then we define problematics linked to parts of the funnel and we let the team decide what of the thing were more interesting than the others but we made sure that the marketing and the product at the end had the same OKR and not different ones and it created some kind of frictions. For example, there was a a girl, a really really brilliant girl, but that was hired for the loyalty program and well, sadly the loyalty program didn't make any any impact on the first and second time users. So, what do you do in this kind of situation? Are you going to take 300K just because someone in the marketing team hired that girl for that or well laas we could not invest on that? And this is one of the friction that we've seen with marketing is that on the product teams well we can reconfigure the product teams whenever we want um even though we have to respect of course domains etc and the other functions could not and that's creating some kind of frictions here and there. Um so this is a way of looking at it and then you need to decide which kind of power do you give um should it be the product teams taking the decision in the end should it be a board should it be a common decision does someone have to do the arbitration if they don't agree there are plenty of rules um the only thing is to make sure that at the end we know who takes a decision and we know who's going to be co-responsible if things actually work or don't Super. Thank you. We've got a question in the chat from Raphael. I think this will probably be the the only question we have time for. Um, so Raphael asks, "Fris, based on your experience, what is the real adoption of this perspective among companies understanding the product as a business ROI tool rather than just about who beautifully puts together the best set of frameworks?" >> Definitely pretty low. Uh and this is really something that I I've seen sadly so many product teams complaining about well we're not a fat factory ah don't call me that etc etc but they don't do anything to change it um they think they do about using the frameworks but actually you're still stuck in your own small language right so sadly a I'm sorry to say that but yeah the adoption is low so well you can be the first one to actually apply are it in your company and whatever I don't know where you come from and considering your name you might be Italian and in Italy uh for example there are not a lot of companies that are not feature factories sadly so you can be a pioneer fantastic well for thank you once again um for coming your time to this um I love the way that you think about uh product and and these investments I think it's a really clear way of of communicating to to I've put your uh LinkedIn uh URL if people want to connect with you and follow up there and obviously people know that if they want to see the recording uh or sign up to further events I've put the uh links for those in the chat as well. Um but with that I will say thank you very much and hope to speak to you soon. >> Yeah and uh LinkedIn is best way to connect with me really. So if you have any question, reflection, whatever, or thing that you do not understand, please, please send me a message on LinkedIn. Uh it's still a product for me, so I'm happy to receive feedback even if it's negative. Right. >> Super. Thanks very much. >> Bye-bye. >> Bye everyone.
