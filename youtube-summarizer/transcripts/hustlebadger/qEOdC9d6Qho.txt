Good evening everyone. Lovely to have so many of you on the call. I am Ed Biden. I'm one of the co-founders of Hustlebger and I'm delighted we've got um Sim with us here today to talk about Cloud Code. Um before I hand over to him, you know, little bit about Hustleb, we give people um training and support on a whole range of product management and increasingly AI skills. And we've got courses, wikis, templates for AI prototyping, for building AI products with evals, for creating agents. And um, you know, Sim has actually been part of our community for like many years, right, since the beginning. And um, he helped us build out our agent courses as well. is one of those people that is like a go-to person for me when I'm trying to get my head around um something sort of new in the AI space, which given that I kind of teach literally hundreds of people how to use AI, like you know, Sin is the person that the AI trainers go to for for their advice. So, yeah, really delighted to have him on the call when he's not well also when he is playing around with claw code. Um he's a PM himself. Um, but I'll let you do a kind of a a longer uh intro um send about what you're up to and what you can do with claw code. Over to you. >> Cool. Sounds good. Yeah, thanks for the intro. Um, yeah, great to meet everyone and I'm going to just dump jump straight in because we haven't got that much time. I've got a lot I want to to cover. Um, so yeah, when I when I was going through and uh making this webinar, it felt like there was a new claude release every five minutes and I had to keep updating it. But as a result, I've tried to keep it a little bit fresher. What I'm going to aim for is really giving you the principles and understanding that you can then go and tackle any update that comes through. Um, so it won't be everything you can do possibly with chord code, but it's the baseline fundamentals. Also, pre-warning that I I use a lot of means just to convey stories. Um, and so you'll be seeing more of these in today's presentation. So when I was playing around with these different tools, um, good to see that some of them were included like anti-gravity, cursor, I found that I had to have like a different subscription for each different tool and it became so much to handle. But I was I was thinking, oh, surely there's a better way to do this. And there was there's one tool that you can use for general querying with the day-to-day life, but then also to build things with. And that tool is clawed code. So yeah, as Ed mentioned, I'm I'm Sim, senior PM, current PM at Punter Health. Uh, but I I used to have my own startup beforehand. Uh, I specialize in 0 to1 and I like to build things on the weekend. More importantly though, I use CL code all the time for my PM work. One of my team members, I can see BB is on the call and she can attest to my uh preacher level commitment to to Claude Code. Um, but yeah, just also to mention that I'm not actually affiliated with NOPIC in in any way. Uh, just a big fan of what they're doing. But in terms of what I use it for, we're a small startup that I work in. So, every person has to wear many hats. Um, but what I I use a lot of control for code for is to write a bunch of things. So, automated newsletters, quant applications, regulatory documentation, dynamic PRs straight from the codebase. And it saved me tons of time and hopefully I'll be able to show you how to save yourself just as much time. And then I also build things with it as I mentioned. So I can build prototypes for discovery. I can build some SAS tools for myself. Um and all of that is just with one tool. So which is really great. Uh in order to help me do this with um just myself, I have sub agents within Claude that all have different personas. So, it's a little army of I don't know, claudites. I don't know what the mini version of Claude would be. Clauditos. It's a mini army of Clauditos who uh can help me out whenever I need for specific things. And yeah, again, I'll show you exactly how you build these yourselves. I kind of had the slide in just to kind of see really top level uh feedback on what your familiarity is with clawed code just because so I can kind of cater how I frame things. Um, cool. Good to see most people have never used it before. Some have used it regularly. Cool. Thanks for the engagement on that one. I appreciate it. Um, so yeah, I've got a bit bit for everyone in here. I'll go through the fundamentals, but every now and then I'll throw in some tips and tricks that should hopefully make it uh useful for if you already have been using it for a while. Um, I've also got this slide. Sometimes I guess not many people have their their cameras on and I I'm very visual to see if things are connecting or not. I appreciate though that you may not be in a session where you can turn your camera on, but if you are, it'd be great to see your face. Um, cool. So, what we'll go through and cover off today is uh what is broad code? How can we get started? Uh, and then we go into the next evolutions, how do we master context for all things documentation, how do we go through and create the commands, sub aents, and prototyping to really take us through to the next level. So starting with claw code. So if I was to look at regular claude or chat gbt or any one of these other lms, you kind of have this case where there's silo documentation where you might have a project where you have maybe all of your PRDs and another project where you have your newsletters in and you have to go through and dip in between them and they can only be used as context for lord but claude can't create them directly for you with within that. However, on claude code side, you are able to have everything as context. You don't need to pick and create these special projects. You can just say here's everything. You have access to everything. And then Claude can then not only read it but also write it directly. So rather than saying here's a massive word doc, please can you update it and send me a fresh version with the changes, you just say, oh, can you go and do the changes yourself? Which is a massive timesaver. One of the best things about it in my opinion. One of the caveats that we will go into how to address later on is that cloud code is stored locally. So in the same way you have your like downloads and documents folder on your laptop or computer and that's where the claw or cloud code will live. Another big benefit of cloud code is its ability for parallel task execution. So regular board or Gemini or JPT you say you want to do uh like a user interview synthesis you might do it for participant number one then copy paste the prompt do it for number two copy paste the prompt do it for number three but with claw code you can just say look at all three of those interviews and run it in parallel all at once which saves you a ton of time and lastly as well you can use agents as I mentioned rather than having to go through the sequential approach. You can say >> this one's >> a little bit. >> Um, so uh and yeah, so in terms of then you have the different agents or you can delegate tasks to the agents and each one of those has their own context window. So you're not sucking up the context of Mega Claude, you're telling Baby Claude, go and do this for me. So yeah, product managers have to be really good at delegating and this is good practice for doing just that. Cool. And moving on to the next one. Uh this is one of the prerequisites for your code. So unfortunately you do need to pay. It's only £15 a month. It's not the most expensive subscription out there and in my opinion it is super worth it. But if you are thinking about using claw code um you need to pay for it. But hopefully by the end of this presentation I would have convinced you to do just that. In terms of options for getting access to short code, there's a few different approaches you can do. So if you're thinking about in terms of ease of setup and the power of what you can do with that tool, it starts off in the top left with web- based tools. So you just go on your browser, you can get access to it. There's also then desktop which you download natively to your computer. VS Code which is my favorite one and I'll explain why. uh and then walk uh rest the terminal interface which is what it was initially made for but in my opinion it's not quite as intuitive as VS code so most of the screenshots that I will use for my examples will be from VS code and as I mentioned claude lost or anthropic rather have been doing a lot of updates and claude co-work has just come in from left field um which you need uh need them the max plan which is a lot more expensive than 15 quid I myself don't even have the Mac fan, I still just pay for Pro because it gives me a lot of what I need and so I can't quite comment myself on where this sits, but when it gets uh put out for more wide distribution with you, but that in my opinion, from what I've seen online, it looks like it's made for this kind of desktopy area in terms of um yeah, ability. But I agree with Ed. It's definitely going to be the future and I'm looking forward to getting my hands on it. straight into what these options look like then. So in terms of the web um and pre I'll leave this with saying that I don't think this is uh great to start off with because it's more catered towards engineers and I myself am not technical. I should have said that in the in my bio section but my background is in science not in engineering. So I don't actually know how to code. Um so yeah I wouldn't recommend starting off in the web version of claude code. it needs GitHub access and can't access local folders at the moment and so it isn't the best. Um, you would get to it by clicking on this code button on your left p within uh the web version. And as I mentioned, yeah, the the pros is exactly where you're already using claude. You can get clear session history, but there's limited scope and you need to really use GitHub for it. Moving on to desktop, they're going slightly down that chain. um similar UI but you are able to access local which is useful um you can get access to the folders that are saved on computer and I only use it really for quick one queries um as standalone tasks because it hasn't got the same power in terms of manual file editing/comands and and those sorts of things but just a quick note that pro will probably improve that so yeah ask me again in a few weeks time and then maybe desktop will be the the best way to use cloud code and then you got VS Code. So, in my opinion, this is the the best of of both worlds. U it gives you the ability to use cloud code in a side panel, which I'll explain more in detail. And also in the terminal, you can edit it within uh the code editor and you can also navigate it within the sidebar. Uh it makes me feel a bit like an engineer even though I'm not one as well, which is always a bonus. Um, in terms of the other pros, so yeah, you can navigate it really easily. You get a lot of power from the slash commands under agents. It's really easy to have different tabs open and session history, which is always really useful. It is slightly more complex to get started with, but hopefully by the end today I'll kind of show you how to use it um if you haven't been familiar with it already. Uh, and it's also not synced with the online chats. And then the last one is warp. It doesn't normally look like this, but this is the custom kind of background that I've put on on my one. And this is really a terminal that um it's like a it's a it's software that you can get for free. There is a paid version, but you don't need the paid version for what I'm showing you today. And it gives you the terminal interface that you can speak with Claude. Uh but you can also go through and look at uh the files you have and the uh the read sorry the the diffs whenever changes are made. you can see in here and you can also edit it with code in the code view as well by itself. Yeah, kind of going through those different pros. Uh the thing that I use walk for the most which is like the coding based things because it's really great for being able to install dependencies. It has a nice original interface for planning mode. But the biggest caveat is that there's no session history or at least I haven't figured out how to get it set up. So it's not great for when you need to come back to something. You have to have lots of tabs open to be able to do it. Benefit I like the most though is that it really makes me feel like an engineer because you're you're in the terminal and it is it's great and uh yeah. Um so that's a a big one for me. Which one should you use? Uh in my opinion depends on what you're trying to get out of code. Um oh god if I had a plan for every time I said explore code this webinar be a rich man. Um the first one is documentation and I assume work will come and take up this use case. Um so I'm not going to focus on that too much. Uh the next is VS code which allows you to do the documentation but also the sub agents and commands and then the prototyping and writing code itself. And then there's war which in my opinion is better optimized for these two use cases on the right. If you do want to look a bit more into work, u cla did quite a nice breakdown that I read the other day that I recommend checking out just if you're curious to see what that would look like. Cool. So, moving on to how to get started. The prerequisites for getting started with Claude as I mentioned is Claude Pro, but you also need to download Node.js because Claude code is essentially an app and Node.js JS is needed to to run it. You can get this um either from their website or from warp. Um I really really recommend downloading warp and using this because it will be so useful cuz as you go through you might get tripped up on on other things and warp can help you install dependencies. It's more intuitive than a regular terminal. You can like click around, you can open for folders. Uh it's a way easier way to get started. Again, I'm not affiliated with W either, just a big fan. Um, you can get it from their website and once you've got it, all you need to do is type in please install node.js and it'll go into its magic and install that for you. It might ask for a few permissions, but you can get that done within there. Um, and then you can go into uh the terminal once that's been installed and then download the bit of code that you need to install for code. It's different for Mac and Windows. So, depending on which one you want to do, you can have a look at that. Um, oh, too soon. Um, I'm just going to also pull open uh and get the link for you. Put it in the chat. Um, just in case you you want to have a look at that in the the background as well. But yeah, have a look at those and then just paste it into warp as it is and that will then download for for you. You'll see a bunch of stuff happening on screen, but that's just it installing. Once it's installed, you can just double check it's done properly with this little prompt here. Cool. And then that's pretty much it. You can install claw code. You're ready to go. All you really need to do is just call clude. Um, and to do that, you just type in in your terminal either in warp or in uh VS Code Cloud. It will maybe ask for permissions to get access to that folder. And then boom, you're you're in. And honestly, for me, like when I type in Claude, this is how it feels like. It's like I'm summoning a mythical ES. That's so powerful. Um, and it's uh, yeah, it's really great because you just jump in, it finish the UI, and then you're good to go. So, you might think, okay, cool. Like, that's great. I'm ready to go. Thanks for the webinar, Sim. I'm off. Um, but not quite yet. There's a few things we need to consider first. Uh, and that is it matters where you are where you when you because that will be where you place your claw. MD file, which is the instructions guide for for Claude. So if you think about like your average folder um hierarchy um depending on if you're in the account and organization folder for example if you call claude here and set up the folder there you'll only be for the nested folders within that but if you do it in the root directory then it'll be for all of those and when you're getting started I recommend doing it there but the kind of mental model that I see it really is of a house if you imagine your computer folders as a house And at the top you have like the root level. So if you call Claude at the documents or user level, it can include all the different rooms, everything within it. Um you can then get C can get access to those which is where I'd recommend getting started out. It's great for like universal um instructions like um I want to have everything in British English for example. Um and you can put that at the the root level when you call Claude. You then have the project level. So this might be if you're working on a specific side project, you can then call claude within there and set up a cla.md file that can give it specific guidance to what's going on in that project. Um, and then even at like a more direct level within the folders as well, you can give specific instructions. Um, and that's kind of also quite useful for restricting the context that Claude needs to read every time it's being called. As I said, the root one's best for getting started. I recommend doing it there. project is good if you want to separate out the work streams and have consistency. But if you want to look at using the context size or applying special restrictions or instructions, I recommend doing it at the folder level last. But I do this first, then this and this. Um, and the reason for that is because when you, this will make a bit more sense later on in the webinar, but when you're calling your agents or calling your commands, it's based on where that particular Claude um file is at the moment. So, if you're up here in this room and you you call Claude um but the the file was marked um was created in this particular folder here, you won't be able to get access to it. So bear that in mind when you're creating your your folder. To set up this this file, the claw.md file, you do navigate to the folder you want. Again, root one recommended someone clawed like it's a mythical being and then type slash in it. Um, which is great as a British person because it's it's slang in the UK as well. So I always say that I have to say that when I'm when I'm doing it. Um, but yeah, so you can type in it. And this takes us to our first uh top tip that I' I've got. And that is when you're creating this file using in it, give Claude context about what is in the folder and what you're going to use it for. Because if you just do in it by itself, it will default to coding use cases and that might not be the most useful one for you. So in this example here, just say, oh, maybe just a folder dedicated to creating email newsletters. So please consider this when creating the file. You can then use like an Russian Joel style. You can have a bigger one at the top and as you go down that folder hierarchy, you can say okay now I'm in a folder that is nested in it. Please bear this in mind. Don't duplicate things. Uh and Claude will have that context of what is around it to know to build the best uh MD file for you. But how do we get in VS Code to the particular folder that we want to navigate to? And the same with warp. Um, I'm going to go through kind of how to do this. So hopefully it's not too entry level, but in my opinion, it's really useful because when I first downloaded VS Code, I had no idea what I was doing. So I'm just going to go through top level how to navigate both Warp and VS Code. So within Warp, this is what it see. It looks like the terminal, but down here you have this nice uh UI where you can navigate based. If you click on that um icon, it will open up and it'll show you where you're based um in the default directory. If you click this button on the left panel here, you can then open the left side so you get a better map as to where you are so you know if you're in the right place when you want to call Claude. I should have done a meme for better call Claude instead of better call S than opportunity lost. Um, then if you're looking at VS Code, um, first you do is install it, um, online, uh, or you can even ask Warp to install it for you. And honestly, Warp is so good. I really recommend it. Um, and then once you've downloaded it, all you need to do is click open folder and navigate to the folder that you want to start your project in. You'll then be able to see on the left the kind of folders within that. Sorry, Ed, go for it. >> Yeah, sorry, just to jump in here, Sim, because we we had I was interested. We also had someone else asking when you talk about VS code could you substitute in cursor or anti-gravity here like a different IDE or is this specific to VS code? >> So my approach with how I use code for documentation is specific to VS code because in my opinion it's the best for editing the context. I have tried with anti-gravity but anti-gravity tries to like you it tries to get you to use their own models to use Gemini. um you it it does work and it's honestly when I prototype my side projects like I use gravity and it's really good for that but specifically for like my more product manager use cases I do recommend VS Code but please have like have a go let me know it's better like I'm always learning with these things so keen to hear your thoughts but yeah so with that in mind um one thing that VS Code does give you that I don't know if you get through cursor anti-gravity Not so sure, but that's the extensions. Um, because what you can do is you then install the claw code for VS Code extension. Make sure it's the one from Anthropic. Um, and that would be really helpful for getting started because you can just natural language ask it to do stuff without having to uh initialize. So, you just once you've installed it, you'll see the option for it on the right hand side. You do have the tonal option at the bottom as well, which you can get to if you click the the button there, and that will open up like this. The the first option on the right is the sidebar um which is more similar to the classic clawed experience and kind of my preferred one for quick ones. You can see your past conversations. You can open up new chats. Really easy to navigate. And then the more powerful option at the bottom is terminal, which is why I use only to do slash commands that are more powerful. Um because yeah, you can't do all slash commands in the sidebar, but I'll explain why in a little moment. You might be thinking, okay, great. There's two options. I've just given you more things to decide what to do. But in my opinion, I'd say start with the sidebar, treat it like it's a regular instance. You can ask it like regular questions. You can have a chat with it. It doesn't have to turn into clawed code mode. So, it's really great for planning because you can see it really nicely. And then when you want to go into building things, then look at the terminal. But if you are keen for the terminal, honestly, just use warp in my opinion. like way cleaner UI, way easier to use than the the VS Code terminal. Um, and yeah, if you want to open up several conversations, you can just do it in the plus. So, yeah, on now we found our folder we want to do it in, we've used VSOs to get there. For the sidebar, we don't need to summon Claude because it's already there just chilling on it side. But then in you do need to initialize it. So, make sure to add context when you use that slash command. Um, it's also worth mentioning if I go back, if you click on this uh slash icon here, you can also choose slash commands just by clicking on it rather than having to type it in. But I recommend getting used to type it in because we're trying to feel like engineers and that's how they would do it. Um, that brings me to uh to top tip number two. Um, and that is when you are navigating stuff, you might be thinking, okay, where's my docu folder? And it's hidden. The bastards, they hide it from you by by default. And the reason um well there's the various reasons for that but to reveal it there's different approaches depending on if you're Windows or on um a Mac uh on a Mac you go open up finder do command shift plus oh sorry command shift full stop and that will show the hidden folders so then you can get to it in VS Code. Um, if you're in a Windows, just click view and then click hidden items to show those. And then you'll be able to see where that is in VS Code. And that's really important for when you get to the point of making commands and sub aents because they're within that folder. What's a breath? I appreciate I'm flying through this, but I've got a lot to go through. Um so in in terms of um how we then navigate through code. So now we've gotten past the kind of activation point and now we want to start doing things there is that text box that I showed but there's different ways that you can configure it. It starts off in this mode which is ask before edits. So you it will essentially what it will do is when you say can you write this document it will start writing it but then ask you before it commits anything. Um so it'll double check in with you. Then if you want to switch between this and the next mode, all you do is to click shift and tab. You click on that and it goes to edit automatically. So and that will just go straight in. Um so for example, if you had document, you would say convert this from British English to American English. If you had it in ask for edits, it would stop you at every S to Z, like every little change. But if you just put it in edit automatically, it will go through the whole thing and do it for you. So when you have high confidence, you can just use that one. And then there's plan mode, which is honestly one of the best features of CL code in my opinion. Really great for thinking through what um you need to do. Uh you can it it will create a plan for you that you can review, tweak if you want to. It will ask you clarifying questions and really help you improve the prompt. And all you need to do to get to there is just shift tab twice and you're off. There is also thinking mode. Um, you can either use the slash command or click on this the slash icon to get there. Uh, and I recommend getting good at toggling this on and off because one thing Claude code does is it absolutely eats tokens. And so if you don't need that thinking capability, I would recommend turning it off and then turning it back on when you do need it. It's the same with the model. Um, if you if you're doing a really easy task, don't use the super powerful model. ship um to make sure you're conserving that all important uh context and tokens. And the last one is when you are kind of going going through, you might be asked for permissions on certain things, just have a read through what it's asking you to do as a baseline. And I recommend just saying yes and not saying always allow access because you kind of want cloud code to earn your trust in a particular folder and make sure it's not going to be doing the wrong things. So to do so, just click yes on on that one. Yeah, as I mentioned, it's it's hungry. It it eats it eats up tokens. I never really hit my usage limits until I started using claw code for my uh daily work. And uh it really does eat it up tokens if you don't use it properly. You can type usage like for/ usage to to see where you're at with it. I recommend being intentional with playing mode with Opus models and also the claw.md files because if you remember we have those different ones at the different levels in the house. But if they're really really like lots of context in those MD files, Ford will have to read through that every single time you do a query because those are excludable instructions. So make sure those MD files are super lean and only the stuff you really need uh it to bear in mind each time. Yeah, it's kind of as Uncle Ben famously said, with great power comes great token use and code is really, really powerful. You've just got to make sure it doesn't uh use up all your context immediately. Uh, another top tip when you're using it, you can say you've like written something, maybe there a typo and you canled it, if you just click up on the on the keypad, it will pull whatever was in that last chat into the uh text or chat box. Um, yeah, super super simple, but that saved me a bunch of time before, so sticking it in. Uh, the next one is there's kind of two nice ways that you can direct the attention of Claude to the file or folder that you want. And this is really important for concerning context. Uh, the first is to just use app in the chat and the next is to in that like folder tree within VS Code, you can rightclick and then click copy path and then paste that into the chat and that will show Claude, okay, this is where it is. Because if you say, "Oh, can you go and get me this document?" without saying where it is, it will burn a bunch of tokens just to go and search through everything to find it. So, yeah, get used to calling these. It's um it's uh it knows where you want to work. Um and the last tip on this one is to use the hash symbol. Um cuz you can put in temporary rules for that session. So, say if you're working on something, rather than having to go and update your clawed MD file for that particular session and then work through and then go back and change it, um you can just say, "Ash, here's a rule for this session." And then it will remember that for all of those sessions without having to update it. It's a good way to test rules before you update that file. Another pause for breath because I feel like I'm beatboxing. Okay, let's go. So, the the next one is mastering context. Um, and this is like really where a lot of the power comes from from Claude. It has all the context that it needs all the time. You have, as I said, you have different folders that can access them whenever you want. No more having to copy paste between projects. Everything gets updated automatically. So, say you wanted to draft a P uh so product requirements document based on the the meeting notes. Um, you might say, "Okay, Claude, please do this for And what it will do, it'll go and read this folder, get the backlog refinement meeting notes. It will then read this for folder, get the competitor analysis. It'll go through and look at the road map planning. It'll then go through here and look at the baseline metrics. Then it will then create the document and then put it back into the product strategy. So without you having to lift a finger, it's going to research through all of these things. Really good at finding that context. A tip for doing this well is to structure these folders logically. It's the same way um if you have someone who's just been onboarded to your team and you say go and find the PR, would they be able to get to it by the names of the folders? The answer is no. Then neither will claw out burning a bunch of tokens to make that as easy as possible. Um good question Jamie. That's a sneak preview. I'll get to that in a bit later on in this session. In terms of how to get to local storage, I recommend looking at um creating an index. So ask claude to say can you index where the folders are if it's a bit too complicated then that will help out as well. So now we're cooking with claude but there's one thing we need to be be careful of. Uh and that is the one of the limitations of claw code is the file types that it can read and write directly are only these six that you see on the screen. Um hopefully they'll improve that and I think with or co-work they definitely will because that leans more into like a Google Drive integration play in my opinion. Um but yeah so imagine like so your markdown files could be your PDS your documentation your PDFs can be your reports websites text can be warn notes CSVs can be analytics images can be screenshots can be mockups and then the JSONs can be the structured data but it's tough uh and it probably one of the things that takes me the most time is converting files into format that I need but I I have commands and agents that do that for me so it's not too bad um in terms of the markdown. Um, yeah, you can edit the file directly in VS Code. You can just go through, double click on it, edit it, but just make sure to save because it doesn't auto save. Been burnt by that before. Um, so yeah, simple one, but it's useful for that. Um, in terms of using markdown with Google Docs, Google released a nice feature recently where if you're working in a Google doc, you can just highlight the text, right click on it, and you'll see copy as markdown. You click that and paste it into your VS Code or wherever and it'll paste it in Markdown. If you're then in VS Code, you want to put it back into a Google Doc, you just copy it here. Come back to the Google Doc, right click, paste from Markdown and it'll paste it as a beautiful Google Doc. I have seen that I think they're playing with a native version of this where it would just assume that you're in Markdown or coming from Markdown. You won't need to double click, but I think they're better testing it because it's not consistent for me yet. So here's a pullback option just in case um do I provide templates for each style of documents to edit or write. Um in terms of templates it's it's a very good approach for saving context and making things consistent. So I definitely would yeah recommend you can have a folder called templates. You can have an index within that folder that says which template to use when uh and then claw code will know how to go and use that. So yeah, for sure in terms of getting u from to markdown from wedgeox uh it takes a bit longer. So you can read the file using a tool um and then cl code will then convert that to markdown for editing because you try and open it directly it would just say it's not possible. So yeah in kind of summary if you want to go from docx so a web doc to you can do it to markdown pdf it can be read as by claude but can't be written by claude. um and Excels I recommend converting to to CSVs for creating edit editable context. The next one, and this is the one that kind of Jeremy alluded to, is um the ability to do it within local storage. I'm not sure about Notion, but in my opinion, there's there's a few different ways to be able to get it get your documents into the cloud so can work with them. The first is GitHub, so more engineering heavy. Um but I'm going to just skip through that cuz I don't really use that one. Um, the next one is Google Drive and the other one is Obsidian, which you may have heard about as well. You can, of course, just copy context content across from VS Code to your documents, but kind of defeats the purpose a little bit. So, here's some ways to have it synced by itself. So, Google Drive, One Drive, Dropbox, or any of these tools that let you sync your local files with the cloud, you can also be sneaky and stick a claw MD file within there and use it to operate clawed code from. So for example, I have in my in my laptop, I have a Google Drive unloaded. Um I can then put my claw in there. So whenever files are updated, it also updates on my online Google Drive under the computers tab in my in my Mac. Steps to do that are just download Google Drive or desktop, open up a folder, navigate it on VS Code or W, initialize Cloud within that, and then turn on sync on the desktop app and then it will start moving files across and keep it nice and up to date. Obsidian is a really great markdown based editor um that you can sync on the uh paid plan which is £8 a month. So I'm not trying to get anyone on this call to buy any other software other than Claude. So, I won't go further on this one, but I use it a lot for personal knowledge management and also writing heavy work. Um, there's a bunch of people who do good content about how to use Obsidian and Claw Code. I think Trisha Torres is one of them. So, recommend checking out her stuff if you're more interested in how to use this. It's an investment at the end of the day. So, might be annoying having to convert stuff into into Markdown, but having it in Markdown, it's like the universal language. You put it into any tool. you're not locked into a single platform. Um, which is really good for testing out all these different tools that that come through. So, now moving on to the PSD resistance, uh, commands, sub aents, and prototyping. Uh, in the description of this talk, I promised that I'd teach you how to do it in 5 minutes or less. But let's see if I can keep up to that promise. So, in terms of slash commands, um, these are essentially reusable prompts and workflows. So if you imagine that you previously had like a prompt library, rather than having that prompt library, you can just have slash commands which you can call upon whenever you want. All you need to do is you type in that forward slash slashcomand and then what that essentially is is having all of uh this additional context. So like a huge font based just on two words. Um really really useful. Like this is actually one that I use which is save article. So I I'll just do this. I'll put in link from a URL from an article that I'm interested in and then Claude will go and format that into markdown and give me an executive summary and put it into my Obsidian reading vault. And that's all just from two words. As I said, you don't need to copy paste anymore. You can just say this is the prompt. Um you can do the slash command and then that will then tell CLA exactly the context that it needs to be able to do it. So you can use them to call on agents to follow protocols to gather context. uh use tools really. The list goes on. One really important thing about slash commands that tripped me up when I first started using them because I would make them and then I could never find where the hell they were. And that is it's a they are only visible in the level or below that you set your claw file. So if you're in this room and you create a slash command when you're in this room, it will not work. You won't be able to find it. You have to be in that level or higher. Another really important thing to note that I didn't put on screen, but I just remembered is when you first create a slash command with Claude, it won't be usable immediately. You have to refresh or start a new chat to be able to use that slash command. So, just worth bearing that in mind if you do want in the middle of a session. um like a to to lean really deep on the house analogy, you could have like a stack command to build furniture. I might get documentation, check what tools you've already got in this room, and then call an DIY agent to go and build it. Um some built-in examples of slash commands that are ready to go straight off the bat. Uh the first is /config. Do this first soon as you open code. And that is because you can edit your privacy settings and make sure it doesn't train on what you're telling it, which is really important if you want to have engineers still with your friends after you start using this. So I would do that first and make sure it's uh it's set and then it's kind of set it and forget it and and you're all good. The next one is clear. So what this does essentially just refreshes the whole chat and that's great if you kind of finish your train of thought and you want to just clear the chat or maybe you made a mistake and you want to start fresh you can just do clip compact compresses the context. So build will automatically when you get close to its context window um limit it will compact but you can tell it to compact on purpose so you get control over how to do that. Um and the last one is rewind which it kind of goes back to a previous step. So, say you're prototyping, it got stuck in a a loop, you can rewind to go back to before it messed up. Um, you also just hit escape twice if you're on the terminal. Some commands do only work in the terminal, which is why Warp has the highest power rating of all the the tools. And that's because it it can do some of these slash commands. So if you're caught out and it's not working on clawed code and VS code just use your warp card uh for that particular instance or do it in the terminal view but honestly like the levels of warp versus VS code terminal like warp is so much better for that. So I would recommend another top tip after any slash command you can add more context to tailor it more. So rather than having very specific SL commands for very specific use cases, you can have a more generic one to like write article and then give it more context for that specific article. For example, here with the compact one. It's really useful because you can say I want you to compact all this context, but here's what I want you to keep. I want you to give me a prompt when you compact it that lets me start the next session effectively. That's such a cheat code. But if you don't do that and claude complex by itself, you could lose lots of really useful context. To make your own slash commands, it is really pretty simple. You just need to ask Claude um just say hey Claude, can you help me out with this? So all you need to do is go through and say I want to create a slash command and then describe your use case. Ask clarifying questions to make it use ask me clarifying clarifying questions to make it as useful as possible. Check out the existing commands and then that's it. doesn't take five minutes, takes five seconds and you have your slash commands. What I recommend doing is every time you write a long prompt and you think you might need it in the future, you can just say I should make this a slash command so that next time I need to do that thing, I can just call the slash command. And what you can do is do it retrospectively. Say you've written a really good prompt and you're in the chat. You say, can you make a slash command based on this conversation? That's a nice way to go through it. Hell, you can even make a slash command that makes slash commands. It's like super method, but it really works. Rather than having to go through and create lots of context for something like a slash command, just get someone to do it for you. Honestly, so easy. Um, here's some examples of custom slash commands that I've made in the past. Um, so yeah, you could do one that is competitive research, getting articles, creating PRDs. I recommend when you start off create slashcomands that help you get context into claude so you can feed the beast really easily and then go forward and do whatever you need to do. So I would recommend starting with ones like save article for example. Quick note on claude skills because I know it's a thing that's come up at some point but I'm not going to discuss it in this webinar. Um, and that is Claude skills is really like an expert package for Claude that has instructions, code, um, files and specialized abilities, but things like creating PowerPoint slides for example. But in my opinion, because like what happens with skills is Claude decides when to call them. But I prefer slash commands. So I can control the context of when and where those skills are being used. So I'll say create a PowerPoint using this slash command. And that slash command has the Claude skill information within it. But I'm not just saying create a PowerPoint. And fingers crossed Claude will use that skill because it's not super reliable yet. So that's why I'm focusing on slash commands. Another top tip, and this is like a separate one from Claw Code, but I use it so much in Claw Code, I thought it'd be rude not to include it. And that's you can create text replacements on your computer that help you create text that you use often. So I say this sentence all the time when I'm speaking to LMS. Feel free to ask clarifying questions if needed. So I've set up a shortcut that I just type in at@ clarify and it will will make that whole sentence. You can use it for other stuff like LinkedIn or emails, but essentially here's a gift of me mistyping it and then doing it right. But essentially you can see I just type in arify and it creates the whole sentence. That's a mega mega hack for the whole of your laptop life. Honestly, it saves me so much time. It is though only really usable on Mac. Um, you can have set text replacements in your settings. On Windows, you have to like do a work around where you make it an autocorrect option that will do that. But if you're on a Mac, game changer. Would recommend. I am conscious of time, so I'm going to keep speeding up a little bit, but apologies for the speed of it. But um yeah, so slash commands can also call upon call upon sub agents. You can say slash command and then you'll get mega mega claw will come back sub agents. So now we're into the realm of like how do we use these agents? They have unique instructions. There's specialized expertise like maybe they were a specialist security engineer. Um they're reusable. You don't need to have a separate project for them. They can be used wherever you want. Just call them and they will come and they have different missions as well. You can say I only want my security agent to have the ability to push to GitHub, for example. They use their own context windows. Mega hack, you're like eating context in your main chat, send it to a sub agent. They will have their own context window, which you can preserve your context with your main chat, which is great for when you have to search through tons of stuff because that will eat up your context for really not much gain. So have a sub agent to do that bad work for you. like having an intern please go and do that market research for me. I I don't want to spend time doing it. You can just delegate it and they'll eat the context for it. They can also run in parallel. So again saves time for similar processes but I will note that parallel runs do eat up more cont tokens than doing them individually. So worth bearing that in mind. They live in the doc cord folder folder the one that's hidden. So you can find it under agents in case you need to make any tweaks, but honestly I recommend GCL claw to make it for you. All you need to do is say I want to build a sub agent that does this should do x should not do y and it should uh create uh ask me clarifying questions. And here is uh an actual example of one that I did very recently. And I'm not going to punish you and read it out word by word. I'm going to gift it to you as uh something that you can have a look at in your own time because I am running out of time. But yeah, this is one that I use as a thought partner which is quite quite useful. What's the difference between a slash command and a sub agent? So essentially a slash command is like a prompt um that you can then use to call upon uh different workflows, different activities. um agents is it's like saying how to describe it's like you have all the context of how it should be responding, what its purpose is, uh what files it should look for. It's um I don't know uh if I go back to my uh house analogy, an agent might be a builder that specializes in IKEA furniture and they're really really great at IKEA furniture. And a slash command might say might be build uh I don't know put in lighting fixtures and you can say put in lighting fixtures. You might call upon your builder agent but you might also call upon your electrician agent. So s commands give you the ability to upon different ones. Um but yeah have a look in that in that prompt and it makes it um kind of gives it a bit more context as well. Here's a few examples of sub aents that I've I've got. Um pod facto gets used quite a bit. Um, and yeah, it gets to the point where you want to make an agent for every single person, every little thing. But remember, with great power comes great token use. Be a bit careful with how you're how you're using those. You might feel like at this point you've got all the tools you need to be an expert claude marksman, but you don't want to fall short. And the reason for that is when you're prototyping, it's good to push that record code, but it can take some time. So if you're at high maturity in terms of the idea and high time available, then it's great to use Claude. But if you're not sure what you want to build or you don't have that much time, I use Lovable if I'm being completely honest because it is better for iteration quickly. If I don't have much time and I'm not sure, I'll just sketch it out by hand. Um but then when you get more comfortable with claw code, then you can kind of move through when you have high maturity. But it is harder to to prototype with cloud code. To get started, all you need to do is create agents um that will help you preserve context like the thought partner that I did, have a discussion with that agent to then build out the plan, split it into tasks that it can then be executed on um to preserve context. So you have different work streams and you can assign an agent to a particular work stream. If you're starting from an existing codebase, um, what you can do is clone it from your git repository. Cloud can show you how if you're not sure, uh, create a separate branch to isolate the prototype in um, and then within that separate branch, create a folder that you can then put your claw.md file in. Engineers BB literally had that face as I as I did that. That was great. Thank you. Um but yeah engineers might not be great that you you're working on the code base directly but so a few things that we can do for safe prototyping. The first is to to isolate it. So as I said have a separate folder make sure Claude knows that it should stay within that folder. Tell it that it shouldn't restore dependencies without asking you. You can use hooks which you can have a Google after but essentially that's a way to make sure in a deterministic function that the LLM does something. So before a push to GitHub, it has to call a hook and then you can then have something attached to that that means check with me before you do that. I really really recommend creating an engine engineer review sub agent that you can call in a separate window um and then use that from a slash command subskll. Don't know why that reset. Um but yeah, I would recommend doing that as well. some general tips and tricks compact intentionally like really make sure you uh uh keep your context window for the best performance for claw code. You can use forward slash usage to keep an eye on your token use and use the hash or hash/plugins feature to give claude even more powers. This was more Claude Code 101, but if you want to get into Claude Code 2011, then have a look at plugins and you'll see a bunch of stuff that it can do like font design, data analysis, all that good stuff. It's all uh built in with this plugins feature. I would make sure do ones that are bananthropic first because they are the safest ones. I will I haven't touched ones that are custom made just yet. Um, and another things are really cool, especially if you're prototyping, and that is to change the forout style. If you type that in, you can set it to explanatory, so it will explain what it's doing and why it's writing code. And that's how I've started to understand coding a bit more is purely by having that switched on. Still got a long way to go, don't get me wrong, but it's really a good way good way to learn. So yeah, the last thing just to really remember like if you do get caught up in this process and you're not sure then if in doubt just ask Claude like it is really a game changer. If you get stuck you have it in that little sidebar. Where is it? You have it in VS Code. If I can find slide within the timer that would be great. I had too many slides. Um yeah no you have it within VS Code. is it's really useful. You can then get Claude uh to fix any issues that you might be facing. I can't find the slide. That's embarrassing. Um cool. There's not much time for questions. I had also had some time to do a live demo, but I don't think we'll have that sadly. I'm happy to do that async. Um but yeah, I appreciate it. is a bit like having whiplash with all the animations and and memes, but hopefully it kept you entertained. Um, I have also this kind of end slide as well. >> That that was fantastic. Thank you so much for that um tour of force on uh on Claude and especially the kind of very kind of practical step-by-step tips. Um I'm sure a bunch of people will be going through the recording in detail as they set up claw code. Um there are a few questions here, some of them from me, um in the chat, so maybe I can kind of roll through those if we've got a few minutes. Um Steve was asking, "Do you know how to make a claude extension visible in cursor?" >> Uh that's a good question and I I will openly admit that I'm not the biggest user user of cursor, so I I couldn't tell you. But what I'm going to do in the background is just ask my my best buddy George uh to to find that out for me. But um yeah, I'm not aware at the moment. >> Yeah, great. Um another question, this one from me. Um yeah, voice input is like another one of those um tips that people talk about a lot. If you're using AI tools, can you use voice with claw code or are there any hacks there so you can kind of transcribe what you're saying directly into war or something like this? >> Yeah, like absolutely. I I personally use whisper flow religiously for this. So I have a separate software for it and especially when I want to customize slash command. So I've already got my slash command set up but I want to make it specific to the use case. I would just go in and I would just start speaking about this is my specific use case, all this kind of context. I'll end with my um clarify to make it ask me clarifying questions. Um and then yeah, and then it's good to go. But yeah, I would use it a lot for giving context because voice text is really good for for that. >> Yeah. Super. By the way, if anyone else has any questions, please do stick them in the chat um and we'll get round to them. Final one for me. Um you mentioned a few of your kind of use cases there like writing PRDs and you know dragging context out of different documents. Could you talk us through maybe just like a couple of other like killer use cases where using claw code is just way better than say using chat GPT or kind of like a web version of of claude. >> Yeah, for sure. Um I'll go with ones that I've done myself just for relevancy. One of them is part of my job I work in in Midtech and we had to do a lot of regulatory documentation and a killer use case for claude code for me was to get Claude to scrape several websites in parallel on the regular regulatory documentation guidelines convert those into files that I can use as context in the future. While that was happening, we had a separate tab up that I said okay can go through create like a kind of profile of all the context for my particular medical device so that it can then be used. So I created the context for that and then then I had like an interrogation system where I could then say okay here's the question that I need to create a policy for or document for. I then ask claw to then go and create those based on all the context that it itself had scraped through. Um another one is like with user research for example you can have like if you pull in your canola transcripts your um analysis screenshots from Figma slides or or whatever uh and then also information from product analytics. If you convert that into a CSV file you can have it in a way that you can then query stuff with natural language. So you can export from your analytics platform of choice CSV, stick it in, tie it to context from your user research and say based on the most recent recent user research transcripts, what do you think has caused this sudden dip in retention that you can see in the product analytics and then it can then go and look at different things and it kind of give you things that you can then go through and dive into. Um, and the last example I'll give is understanding the code base. So I cloned an example of our app and I wasn't sure how a particular kind of feature was being used or calculated. And rather than bother BB who's been super patient with me and really helpful, I um I would just ask Claude code and say, "Hey, like I want to figure out what this is, but I have no idea where it is in this codebase. Can you like direct me to it?" And then it kind of showed me where it was. Um I wanted to change like a a snack bar color. Um, it showed me where where that was. I could just say to BB, "Hey, can we change this? Here's the location." And also save her time as well. She's nodding. But yeah, those are different. Uh, the difference between Claude Code and the newer Claude Coordwork. Um, essentially Clawude Co-work is a graphical user interface that will make it easier to use the same powers that I've showed you in Claw Code. So being able to access your local documentation, being able to use commands, I assume I haven't used it myself. Um, but it's made yeah to make it as easy as possible to access, but you don't need to use VS Code or the terminal. I will say and I recommend getting used to VS Code and the terminal though because it's a lot more powerful and gives you way more capability. Um, but yeah, I have a play with Cloud Codework. I I certainly will when I can get access to it. I do actually have one more question. So, is there an easy way of sharing um skills slashcomands, sub agents, those sorts of things with your colleagues so you can work together as a team on them or or are they really kind of like personal tools that you have to like copy paste and send you as individual files to to other people that want the same ones? >> Yeah, great question. Um, [clears throat] I can give you like a nice hacky way of doing it if that's if that's interesting. But what what I've done uh and I was trying to do it for but I don't have time for this webinar. But you can get Claude to create like an HTML that has all the different SL commands in it, post it on something and then get that like that could be your way to share things. So for example, the one that I've just put in the the chat I was like doing one weekend. Um, and you can get Claude to build that from uh where they you can get Claude to build it from its own MD file and keep it up to date. So you can create like a website that has all your slash commands, all your agent prompts based purely on what you have. So yeah, it's maybe a bit more overkill, but like a super cool way in my opinion of sharing with the team. Yeah, super. Thank you. >> Great. Well, look, thank you so much, Sim. As I say, that that was um yeah, really fantastic just um to get some of your your kind of expertise there and um share it with everyone else. So, thank you for for doing that. Um, again, just as a quick reminder, I I have put links in the chat, you know, so if you want to follow uh Sim on LinkedIn uh and find him, um I'm sure we'll be uh happy to answer a few more questions. We'll be sticking the recording of this on our YouTube channel shortly, and we will send you all just a little uh follow-up email with um a link to that and uh a few other notes as well. Um,
