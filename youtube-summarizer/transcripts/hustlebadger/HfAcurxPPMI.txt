Lovely to see so many of you. Uh I am Ed. I'm one of the co-founders of Hustlebger and uh I'll be leading this webinar on leading without authority. Um just a few words of housekeeping as we get going. If you do have questions, thoughts, comments, I'd love to hear from you. Please do use the chat. Um great that you're here live watching the session. Um so let's make it as interactive as possible. Uh this session is being recorded so uh you will be able to catch up on it if there's anything you want to have another look at on our YouTube channel and um I will share some of the details of our of our I should probably share our our YouTube channel in the chat along with um where you can connect with me and um where you can see our our further talks. So I'll dump all those links in the chat right now. Um, but with that, I think I'll keep it I'll keep it fairly short. I'll tell you a little bit about HustleBer at the end. But without that further ado, let's let's start talking about leading with authority. This is this is a topic that's sort of very um, you know, important for product managers because you're often in the position of having to drive things forwards whilst not actually having authority in terms of people don't reporting to you. So you're driving things forwards with your with your cross functional team with the engineers with the designers they probably um reporting to someone else. You're coordinating with lots of other teams maybe customer service or sales or operations they reporting to someone else. So, how do you actually get things to um you know, move forwards? And I think um one of the things that I wanted to talk about a little bit is, you know, these these are things that I've picked up along the way in in my career. And um before I founded Hustleb, I worked, you know, all the way up the the product management ladder from PM to, you know, CPO, CPTO roles. um going up that ladder, one of the roles I had was at depot and I led the the product team there and I hadn't kind of like figured out yeah I was still kind of on that journey even though I was I was a director of product my attitude was a little bit like h my CEO doesn't understand how product management works and the next role that I took I'd had a I'd had the chance to see how more senior people were coming into toot and how they were leading. Sure, they held authority, but I could just see that their their leading was so much better than mine. And that meant that when I joined FutureLearn, my attitude changed completely. And so the way that I started acting was not that, oh, my CEO doesn't understand how product management worked. It was my CEO doesn't need to understand how product management works because that's my job and I they don't need to worry about product management. I will make the product team deliver. And as a result, you know, at depot, yeah, I kind of reached a glass ceiling because I was never really taken seriously by the CEO. Whereas at future learn, having made that mental shift myself, I was in a position where I was then promoted to CPO in 6 months time. And you know, a like authority follows you being able to lead, right? you know, when you can lead people really effectively, that does great things for your career as well as it just being sort of like necessary for the day-to-day uh in in a role. So, a lot of the stuff that I'm going to talk about are, you know, personal lessons or things that I've kind of uh learned on my journey sort of up that uh on that on that career path. the I was thinking about this like well you know what does it mean to sort of be a leader? What what is what is your team expecting from you? What are senior stakeholders expecting from you? And I felt that it kind of came down to actually like a few key things like particularly if you're talking to a you know a CEO like what are they or you know senior stakeholder what are they expecting from you and what are they looking for in terms of of leadership and I thought about it this way like firstly you've got to be really clear in your thinking so you've got to have a logical strategy and you've got to be able to communicate it really clearly. Once you can do that, then you need to be able to follow through. So you need to execute on that plan and make sure that whatever your plan you laid out, that then happens, results in action. And when you get those two things happening in order, that's when you earn trust. You people listen to you because you deliver results and you deliver those results regardless of how chaotic or uncertain um the environment is. And um that whole process like that that again like when you do that for your teams, your teams are going to trust you. Your teams are going to respect you. You're going to be able to kind of um get them to do things for you. But also CEOs, managers, senior stakeholders are also going to like trust you. And um so it's going to help you get your job done. But like I say, it will also lead to you promotions, more responsibility. Um because this is difficult to do. It sounds simple but it is difficult to do. The things that sort of make this a little bit easier to do um end to end are firstly like having great relationships with people bringing people with you and aligning with them and also getting the best from them. So that's not always being nice to people or not being kind of, you know, uh, a yes person all the time, but it's being able to get along with them even when you've got a difficult message that you need to land. So even when you can't do what they want or even when you've got to ask them for a little bit, you know, beyond what they normally be able to give you, you need to have the relationship that you can kind of make that happen. And the second thing that really helps is um having an air of professionalism. So having a sense of like calmness, having an aura of competence that um you know it almost kind of precedes the trust bit, right? You want people to trust you because of the results that you deliver. But you there are ways of projecting that confidence, projecting that trust which are worth having because they sort of you can fake it till you make it a little bit. You can't do that forever. But you know you want to sort of project you projecting an area of professionalism makes it that much easier to follow through on being a professional. Um it's very difficult to you know act unprofessionally and then actually deliver professionally. So to get there, those are kind of the five things I'm going to talk about um in similar words like firstly like strategy, communication. So having that really clear plan of what needs to get done. Secondly, um actually executing on that plan, turning those those words, those thoughts, those action uh the those plans into actions and impact um and building trust. I'm also going to talk a little bit about how you build relationships with people and then just the sort of the the tone and the kind of acting professionally that you can do all the time. It's going to make all of that kind of work a bit smoother. Or start with strategy on that note. So I always think that you when you go into a new role you you don't you don't immediately gain credibility from delivering things and having impact because that takes time. You you sort of start to earn credibility by understanding the business and having unique insights um that people uh value. And those insights broadly come from four areas. Some of these are kind of applicable across your whole career and some of them are kind of maybe more more applicable at different parts of your career. The first one I think is really valuable is data is doing like novel quantitative analysis. So if you go into a business and there are kind of big holes in like how they understand what users are doing and you can then go and do your own analysis and be like oh okay actually I understand the funnel better than anyone else because I know where the drop offs are and I know which steps we should look at because I've compared between segments and the best ones and the worst ones and I can see where the biggest gaps between those segments are. This is like immediately interesting to other people and also shows that you are quantitive and and you know your stuff. Similarly, speaking to users, you know, going and speaking to customers directly, going and doing site visits, um doing that primary research is really really valuable as well. I had a role where I was senior VP of product at a Spanish unicorn called job and talent. It was almost impossible to have credibility with the founders if you weren't speaking to customers directly and regularly and you know that that was their culture. But I think you know that's always going to go down well with people. But I think it's also worth bearing in mind that some of these techniques going to land better in in some companies than they will do in others. another way that you can gain credibility. You know, maybe they've got great tasting, maybe they've got great um you know uh user research, maybe that's not the place where you can kind of make yourself stand out. Um in those cases, often a really good way of uh kind of demonstrating your credibility is to map out processes cross functionally. So you're not looking at this just from a product point of view, but you're kind of mapping things out and drawing together all the different strands from product marketing, customer service, ops. So maybe doing a customer journey map or a service blueprint, something like this. Um, this is a great way to speak to lots of different people, understand their world, and then bring people together into a a shared space. So this is this is another way of of doing it. And the final thing I'd say is, you know, going and betting in other teams. Um, this is rarely possible or we feel it's rarely possible, right? Because we feel we've got so much else to do. But if you do get the chance to do this, it's incredibly effective. Particularly if you're working really tightly with the team. So if you're working on a growth team and you can go and sit with the marketing team for 2, three days a week, that is fantastic. If you are working on a trust team and you go and sit with customer service for for a week and answer customer tickets for them, it's so so powerful because you're effectively yeah you're almost treating them as users, right? And you're not just speaking to them, you're going and walking a mile in their shoes before you um work with them. Um and this is the sort of thing where you think, "Oh, I can't I can't make time for it." I mean, but you make time for holidays, right? you you know the world does not end when you take a week off in the summer and have your well- earned rest and this is the sort of thing that feels very difficult to do but if you carve out the time for it will pay dividends for you know months if not years it's like fantastically valuable so these are kind of like four ways where where I think even before you do anything else if you can just start to kind of get your own insights and start injecting them into the conversation that's immediately going to show that you've got something to add. Um, and for product leaders, something that I often advise is like you you can't just be following everyone else's insights. If you're getting spoonfed insights from a CRO who the data team reports into um, and you never go and speak to users yourself, like of course they're going to treat you as like someone who just does delivery because you're not bringing any insights like to the conversation. So if you want to be part of that strategic conversation, you've got to have your own set of insights that you are kind of not not using to dominate the conversation, but but using it to kind of bring something to the table. Second thing I'm going to say in this is um it's really important to be able to structure and layer your thinking. Um what do I mean by that? Like you broadly you've got to be able to make your case really convincingly. So making your case convincingly is is sort of saying in very concise words like what is your recommendation? What should you be doing? So when someone asks you hey what should we be doing about X? You can say in a sentence or two sentence basically the answer is this. But if they want to dig deeper you've also got to be able to then dig into the details. So any recommendation or point of view that you have, your kind of conclusion in the yellow line here should be supported by lines of reasoning and you should be able to go from sort of talking about the the overall recommendation to sort of going well I think we should do X because reason one, reason two, reason three and those reasons in turn should be supported by evidence you know insight synthesis like um things that you know hard hard facts bas basically if you can lay out your thinking like this and do that both verbally but in emails in documents. It's incredibly powerful for showing that you know you know what you're talking about um and for structuring your your your thoughts. So I'd say this kind of part of this kind of like thinking clearly to be able to lead people and kind of like get convince them of what you want to to do. You need to be able to kind of like make a case with data and make this kind of a logical case. It really helps if you can make an emotional case as well, but you need to be you definitely need to be able to make the the logical case. Um, so I say like yeah, your reasons are backed up by evidence and data. And you can communicate your message at different levels of detail depending on the audience. So if you're speaking in all hands, you might just cover kind of the first two. You might say, "Hey, we're going to do this and we're going to do this because ABC reasons." But if you're talking with, you know, a peer from another function who's really into the details. So again, you're on a growth team and you're speaking with the head of marketing, actually you're probably going to go through each of these points of evidence with them and you're going to try and get evidence from them, right? To strengthen your uh plan so that it's not just your plan, it's a combined plan that you've built with them, right? So the level that you go down into this sort of pyramid or down into this uh into this message, you tailor to your audience and you also tailor the language a little bit, right? Because marketing people have the words that they use and finance people have the words that they use. And when you can talk about, you know, with designers that you're going to do discovery and when you talk with finance people, you say we're going to do due diligence. And when you speak to marketing people, you say you're going to do research. and it's all the same thing, but you're just using the words that resonate with them so that they know what you're talking about. If you can do that, it makes it much much easier to link everybody's task back to the company objective. And so I think of this as thinking like, yeah, if I'm ever asking an engineer to do some work, you know, that could be like fixing a bug or something that seems quite trivial. um I should be able to link their kind of task to our team goal and I should be able to link our team goal to our company goal. That's really important because it gives people's work meaning as well as makes it clear like what they should be doing. So this is much easier if your team goal is directly linked to your company goal and you don't have departmental goals and kind of like side quests and sub goals like try and keep it really really straightforwards. The company wants to do this. It wants to double revenue. It wants to go into a new market whatever it is. Our team is going to do you know build this new product that is going to directly help us increase revenue because we're going to charge for it. Great. you are building you you're doing this ticket because that is on the critical path towards launching this new feature. Okay, you keep that kind of golden thread that then links things all the way through. And the other thing you do is like you keep repeating this, right? people um people have this funny tendency to think that you care about what you talk about. That that that kind of seems like so obvious, but I think people kind of miss the inverse of that. That if you don't talk about things, they think you don't care about them. And that is a danger for leaders where you stop talking about things that are really important. You stop talking about your OKRs because you're like, "Well, we set the OKRs. we'll check on in on them in, you know, three months time at the end of the quarter. People will just assume that you don't care about the OKRs. Or if you don't care about the company goals, people will assume that actually, you know, we've kind of moved on from those company goals. We we're not really sure what the strategy is or maybe we're thinking about some other company goals. Like you've got to be talking about the important things all the time so that people know that they're important. getting that kind of thinking really clear. Um, if you can do that, then another thing you've got to be able to do is share your thinking um, clearly. And I think this is, you know, this is important because because I say we're always dealing with uncertainty, right? So um, even when we've got a nice kind of pyramid format and we've got our reasons and we've got our evidence and so on, there's always going to be holes in that. It's always going to be a little bit imperfect. And what can help sort of you know bring people on board and move the conversation forwards then is dealing with that uncertainty in a sensible way. um which means you know you don't pretend you've got all the answers but you are you do have opinions right even if that's just a hypothesis you can say well we don't have much data here but I think you know my working hypothesis is this right so you've always got a hypothesis to start with and you can explain that and maybe that's like well you know I'm new to this role but I read this book or this happened in my previous role you got some reason and you can then be open to other people challenging you and saying like, "Yeah, yeah, but that doesn't fit with the evidence." That's fine, right? But you've got some kind of starting point and you can articulate how certain you are about it. You can say like, "Look, I think this is this is my hypothesis. Honestly, I'm not very sure about it. So, I'm going to go and do some research." Yeah, but this is this is the starting point. Or you might say, "Look, we're very certain about this. I've done loads of research. I've got, you know, loads of evidence. So yes, I'm open to if you've got other data that shows other things, but I'm pretty sure about this. I would be open about where you have doubts and assumptions and you should be like actively asking people if they know anything about those areas or can think of um, you know, ways of of closing those gaps because there are some very smart, you know, research techniques out there um of analysis you can do. Those aren't always easy to think up on your, you know, your own, right? Um so like be open about you know what are the problems you're grappling with and invite people to come and solve those problems with you and and kind of as well I I'd be particularly as you do get into more leadership roles then I think it's really valuable to be clear about how open you are to changing your mind you know so whether you are a VP of product and you've given a team an OKR and and they're sort of being like I'm not sure this is a good idea or you're chatting to you know you're an individual PM you're working in your team and the engineers you tell your engineers you're building a feature and they're saying does this make sense it it helps you know yes to engage with the with the conversation like to a certain degree but if fundamentally you are not going to change your mind because the CEO's told you do something the board you've got obligations to the board be really upfront about that because this isn't n't going to be a pure democracy like no company is right. Everyone has their their other pressures. And so if it's time for people to disagree and commit, make that clear. If it's time when you want to invite kind of other viewpoints, make that clear, too. Because there is there is a time for both of those. And it helps other people to understand like are you saying hey look this is the best idea I've got right now but I'd love to hear your thoughts because I'm not very comfortable about it or are you saying this isn't a very attractive option but it's the best option we've got and we're now going to execute like vigorously in this direction because we have to like that's quite a different tone um to deal with uncertainty but signaling it really really clearly helps your teams understand where they are um and what's expected of The other thing I'd say is yeah this kind of like being really clear about where you are for clarity like so when you do make a decision make it clear what that decision is right you know what you will do what you won't do um don't leave decisions implied or kind of unsaid because that only invites ambiguity and uh ambiguity sort of is the killer of momentum I think as well just the the more that you can give people examples and references, the faster it is that you will get um clarity about where you want to be, you know, and designers love references like what are your design references for this? It's like your number one question as a designer. But that goes for everything from, hey, I'm thinking of this feature and actually my references are this thing I've seen over there and this thing I've seen over there and here's a screenshot and here's a description and here's a loom I've made of this feature that I think it should be doesn't need to be exactly the same, right? But it's just it's a reference. It's a touch point to help you communicate what you want to do. That works on the individual PM level. It also works at the leadership level where you say, "Hey, look, we're going to be doing OKRs. This is the template I want you to fill in. This is what good looks like, right? This is what a team did last quarter. This is what a team did in my last company, right? That helps you express what you want the teams to be doing in any situation. PS, this is also why Hustle Badge is great. We've got loads of templates. Check them out. You're stuck for examples. We got tons of them. Find the ones that are right for you. Another thing that's really good for adding clarity is um talking about failure modes. So um yeah, anything you can do to define the problem like this is what we want, this is what we don't want. Here's an example. Here's a kind of counter example. We're trying we're not doing this. Like these are really really powerful ways of kind of like helping you communicate where you want to go. Like I say, you you want to be clear about what you're trying to achieve. Okay. Okay, so that was a bit about strategy and account um and and communication. Let's talk a little bit about accountability then. What does that what does that mean for product people and how do you how do you get there? Um so as I say like nothing kills momentum faster than ambiguity. If it's not clear who's making a decision then um that is you know it slows everything down like a huge amount. And you you know go and read the research on this. Like if someone has a heart attack in the street, you know, quite often they'll be left for like a surprising amount of time because lots of people walking around them in a crowded street don't know what's going on. Are they having a nap? Did they sit down? Are they seriously hurt? Nobody knows. And because nobody knows, nobody feels it's their position to get involved. If you're driving down a remote kind of mountain road and you see someone hitchhiking, almost always you stop to see if they're okay because you know you're the one responsible, right? Like you don't have that ambiguity of like what's going on. So, um, as a leader, I think you should be like really checking for ambiguity and trying to close it down as quickly as possible. Um, you know, when you're making decisions, you know, when you go and ask people for their input, it not only helps you make better decisions, but it also helps people buy into the decision, even if you don't take any of their their thoughts on board, right? Because they just feel consulted. They feel part of the decision process. They feel heard even if you've been like, "Great, great." You know, you you can't be too superficial about it, right? You can't be like, "Yeah, yeah, interesting. we're still doing this. You've got to be like, tell me what you think. Great. I'm going to think about it. And then go back a little bit later, be like, great, I've thought about it. We're still going to do this. It makes a big difference that the framing of it, right? But a thousand times better than sort of just rolling out a decision without asking people even what they think. Um, as I say, like it really helps if you're, you know, going back to what we were talking about developing credibility and matching people's language. When you can frame things like you've got the insights to back up your decisions, you can match the language of the audience. This makes a huge difference to like how people um receive it. Um, as you make decisions, you've also got to like make the decision happen as in you won't be the decider for every decision that affects you. But yeah, it helps. What you can always do even if you're not the decision maker is you can force the decision along or you can try and force the decision along. So if this is something that's got to go to the marketing team and the head of marketing is going to going to decide on it, the CRO is going to decide on it, the CEO is going to sign off on it, nudge things down that that path like um as aggressively as possible. So if it's your decision, you can say, "Hey, this is the plan. This is not the plan." If it's someone else in the room, you might say, "Oh, sorry." If you need a bit of time, right? Like maybe you're talking about something, you've had a big discussion, you're not really sure what you want to do. What's a really good practice is not to necessarily say make a snap decision be like oh we're going to do this. You can give yourself time but make a commitment about when you're going to decide by. That's good for your yourself to have that discipline. It's also really good to communicate to the teams that this isn't going to float like this isn't going to drift on and on and on. There will be a decision. It's also you're clarifying that you are going to make it. Sometimes though as I say like it's not your decision. it's time to kind of really push it on someone else. And in that case, you know, you can imagine like often you have a big discussion. It's not really your call, it's the tech leads. Ask them like put them on the spot. Be like, okay, are you ready to make it? If you're not ready to make it now, when will you decide by? Right? This is not being mean. This is holding people to account. This is making uh your teams more effective. And um people will appreciate this like as long as you do it in that kind of like you know kind generous like supportive way right so um give them that option like asking you know are you ready to make it now is is a little bit softer than saying what's your decision regardless of who makes the decision writing things down following up things with a either like an email updating your, you know, your PRD, your confluence page, whatever you've got, having a separate decision log. These are all really strong ways of reducing the amount that decisions are revisited. Like decisions are always revisited a little bit, but you want to try and kind of like minimize that to, you know, whenever there's a kind of significant, you know, change in in context or a significant um set of new insights that make you revisit things. So these all kind of help you make decisions a little bit better. The other thing I think it's worth talking about accountability is like owning the outcome. Um so your job is to get the job done. We are not like no one cares about no one outside of product cares about like are we doing product management correctly like there is no correct way to do product management. There are just patterns that are sometimes useful. Um so don't worry about sort of does the framework fit or anything else. Just worry about like do people understand uh what we're trying to do? Do they have clarity? And is that helping us move towards our our goal? Is that making life better for our customers? Is that making uh the business perform better? So but also like you know when you make a commitment you've got to you've got to keep your commitments right. We'll talk about this a little bit, like, you know, when you say something's going to happen, you've got to make sure it does actually happen. Um, don't wait for people to chase you. Like, anytime people are chasing you, then your update is late. You want to be proactive about your coms. Um, and you've got to be proactive about chasing other people as well. So if people you know if you if people understand by working with you over a period of time that you never follow up they won't keep their commitments because why would they right? So if you ask an engineer to do something you ask colleague to do something you do need to be that annoying person that kind of follows up in a week's time or whenever you said you would. And whatever your system is for staying on top of this. you know, you keep notes in a physical notebook, you have a Trello board for yourself, you write it in, you know, just a sheet of paper, like it doesn't matter, but you have to have some system that allows you to keep on top of this. Um, and what I would do is like I would often keep things like super super simple when I was um an individual contributor PM like working in a team where I just use uh Mac notes but I would have above my to-do list but my list of like when I need to chase people, what is the date, who am I going to chase, what am I going to chase them on? And so before I even get round to my tasks, I'm checking like have I hit the dates of anything I need to check chase anyone else for? When is that going to happen? Put it in a diary. Do whatever. But you've got to figure out some kind of system to to keep on hold on to it. Okay, let's talk a little bit about trust. Trust, as I say, it's it's both like an output of um of this this process, but it's also it can be a bit of an input, too. So, um I think that you know trust follows you you kind of earn trust when you make commitments and then you deliver on them because people then start to be like well you know Ed said this and usually when Ed says things they happen so probably it's going to happen. Um so you want to kind of like reinforce that pattern again and again. When I went to future learn, I was almost like, yeah, and and I was in this phase where, yeah, that six months before I got promoted, I made several commitments. I made commitments to the senior leadership team. I made commitments to the engineers, we were working on a on a big project. I won't get into all the details uh right now, but we're working on a very big project. And my commitment to the senior leadership team, the SLT, was we will ship before the end of the year. this for us given where we were, given what we were shipping, seemed like an aggressive timeline. Um, but I was happy to make it and I was happy to kind of um almost stake my reputation on it a little bit. I went and spoke to the engineers and I said we are going to ship by the end of the year which they weren't very happy about but I said that hey we're going to have 4 weeks for tech after we ship. So by giving the engineers that time after we'd shipped to do tech debt, I kept the engineers happy. It meant that they were then happy to kind of sign up to this commitment to ship by the end of the year. So, everyone was kind of happy, but I'd also made commitments that I was willing that I could keep and then by keeping those I kind of got a big kind of uh amount of credibility and trust from the people around me. So, what am I saying here? Yeah, trust comes from making commitments and keeping them. You've got to be making commitments. I if you're not kind of making firm commitments about what will happen or what you will do, then people will not trust you. If you're always kind of dancing around the the topic and you're kind of giving soft commitments or you're kind of like, well, we'll see what we can do. I mean, like sometimes you need to do that. But there's also there's there's obviously like there's a huge power and value to being able was like this will happen by this time. Trust me, I will make it happen. like CEOs, C like senior execs, they want people they can trust to make things happen. Like that is so valuable for them. Yeah. And you've got to figure out your way of keeping them as I say of keeping these commitments. But that goes back a bit to being like you are going to you've got to be the person that chases you've got to be the person that keeps on top of your to-do list. Um I think worth bearing in mind that yeah trust is not something that you earn once and you're done, right? Trust is something you have to be continually earning. So it's got a halfway. If it decays over 3 to 6 months, you know, it halves every 3 to 6 months or so. So if you're not continually making commitments and hitting them, trust tails off. Worth mind. Um I mentioned this already, you know, any update that is asked for is like you want to be like when things go wrong, you've got to kind of get on top of that really really quickly. Um, in any organization that is moving quickly or especially in organizations that are moving quickly, things go wrong all the time, right? Because you don't have time to kind of think through every eventuality and you are kind of working through uncertainty. So obviously if you're like consistently wrong and you're costing, you know, lots of time and lots of money, that is not good. But if you're one wrong on a one-off basis, like you made the wrong call about the strategy, I would not worry about this too much, right? That's almost expected because you're dealing with uncertainty. But what you should be really clear about is what you're going to do to fix it, how fast you're going to do that, um, and if you need any help from other people to fix things as well. So why be transparent about your, you know, things going wrong? Well, no one can help you if you're not, you know, if they're not clear what the problem is. So, the bigger the problem, the more you need to draw people in because it will be less something that you can deal with on your own. The other thing is, and and and this is something I really realized as a um as a product leader is that fixing things take time. I kind of assume that if I'm running, you know, six product teams, eight product teams, that there are going to be problems along the way. All that I want as a product leader is enough time to solve those problems. So it's the sort of, you know, forewarned is fore armed. If I know something's going to go or has gone wrong, but we've still got 4 weeks till whatever the deadline is, the shipping deadline, the having impact deadline, that gives me lots of time and space to do other things. Whereas, if someone tells me the week before the deadline, you know, oh, we're meant to ship tomorrow, but actually we're going to have to push it back a week. that is a disaster because with a day to go there's there's there's nothing I can do really. So think about sort of like what is that um runway you've got uh before deadlines and things come through. I think also worth you know mentioning again you obviously can't be kind of like telling people things are going wrong all the time but when you do it sparingly this is not a sign of weakness. This is this is a sign of authenticity. Um, and it increases trust. So, if generally you're saying like, "Look, we're going to do this, we're going to do that. Things are kind of cracking along fairly fairly well." And then occasionally you're like, "Oh, flag. This has gone wrong. I need some help here." This will boost your credibility. It will because people can then put even more trust when you say things are going well, that things are actually going well. They know that you're going to admit to mistakes um when they come up. So, I bear that in mind, too. Okay. Uh, how are we doing for time? Great. Relationships. A few points then on relationships. As I say, these kind of like make everything go a little bit better. And, um, I think, you know, the strate, you know, everyone's going to have their own kind of personal strengths and weaknesses here. For me, I was always very strong at the strategy stuff. Um, the accountability was something that I I kind of learned that next. and relationships is, you know, I think I've got better and better over time. um the harder the message you need to give to people, you know, the the easier as it is if you know them better. Kind of which seems a bit bizarre. If you if you think about, you know, which of your friends could give you really tough feedback or which people in your life could give you really tough feedback, tell you your breath stinks or something like from most people, you know, your colleagues you work at, you know, the the the the parents you meet at the school drop off, they're not going to tell you your breath stinks. No, that like relationship suicide. But your mom, you know, she would tell you your breth. She'd be like, "You need to brush your teeth." Um, and that is a good thing that you know, someone's going to tell you that, right? So, I think about like the stronger your relationship, the worse news you can give them and you can do it in a kind of, you know, positive way that is good for for everyone. So, um, it's worth investing in getting to know the people who you work closely with, right? So, that can be engineers, it can be stakeholders, right? but but build those relationships. And in I had breakfast with someone who was like very senior at um Instagram uh a few months ago and it was really interesting cuz she said, "Oh yeah, one of the things about um Meta is that when you join, everyone seems super nice and super interested in who you are as an individual." And you know, then then one of them told me like, why is like cuz they want to have that personal connection so that they can have really tough conversations with you really quickly. So they're almost on an accelerated kind of get to know you drive in your first few weeks. Um, you know, so be human with people like talk about things other than work once in a while. Share a few details about yourself. You don't need to share all of your personal life obviously, right? But share some details. share something you're happy to kind of make you seem more human and be interested in other people like that relationship is going to pay make it easier then to ask for favors and to also kind of give tough feedback. other thing I think is super important and particularly when you're talking about um stakeholders outside of product is to really understand their viewpoint and their interests like it's not their job to understand how product works right it it's your job to understand what they need from you and how you can support them um so try to understand things like what are they worried about what do they see as success like how are they going to perceive you a success or not a success. Try and match them in terms of like what are the language, what are the met metrics they use. Like being able to sort of like put things in their terms makes it much much easier for them to understand. Um and you know understand that underlying motivation and you again like designers engineers as soon as you spend a bit of time about it with them you're like oh yeah they really like it when we do this they really don't like it when we do that. This is not just true of engineers and designers, right? This is also true of your um as a kind of more senior executives. Um and I think worth bearing in mind that executives and particularly CEOs are usually stressed most of the time, right? They have high pressure jobs and you will be in their good books if you kind of net net reduce their stress rather than add to it. So yes, you should challenge them if you think they're doing something wrong, but generally you want to be also kind of taking stress off their plate and providing them with answers and saying, "Hey, like maybe I don't think this is the right approach, but why don't we go this way and I can do this and I will kind of take that stress or that anxiety off you and I will kind of let you worry about other things." This is always a good approach. Um, and when you're dealing with kind of, you know, often some of the most interesting problems to deal with as a as a PM are almost like these intractable how do we kind of square the circle? How do we make kind of ends meet? In these cases, then I think it really helps if you firstly you've got some kind of sense of um reciprocity like of give and take. you know, you're going to have to launch something. You haven't fit in all the features that the head of marketing wanted. Can they actually change their campaigns a little bit? Like things get done when you can call in a few favors. And to be able to call in favors, you've got to be able to kind of also pay out a few favors. So try and start things on the right track. Try and kind of get in people's good books by going a little bit beyond what you might necessarily need to. So you've got some, you know, um, some karma in the bank, right? So you can ask for a thing, a few things back. And, you know, as you get to know people, as you kind of like pay out some favors, then you think of this as you you kind of you should be like building a team of allies, right? Like when you're the biggest problems cannot be solved by one person. And I think PMs are very quick to think of solving problems in a crossf functional kind of development team with engineers with designers maybe with data people but often less willing to kind of go to you know marketing people, ops people, sales people and and collaboratively solve problems with them. And um you really want to work out like who are the people that you can reach out to and work with. You particularly when things are especially difficult, you really want to think about um you know your as you go up the kind of as and when you go up the ladder of of of management, if you become like a head of product or a VP of product, your team is not the people reporting into you, right? your your team is actually your kind of your peers in different functions. Um and having those people as allies that you can work together with is what's going to allow you to do really impressive things. Um I kind of stuck in here as well. Yeah. I mean for difficult decisions as well like lean on your allies like re like meet with them early reagree with them things so that when you go into like a big group meeting and you're presenting to the SLT you're not kind of you're not alone in there kind of delivering some tough news or forcing people to make a tough decision. you can actually be like look I think it's this this is the recommendation and you've immediately got someone who's going to chime and be like yeah great I I support this decision I think this is also great because of these reasons you know you can pre-align with people makes a big big difference to how easy it is to um move along you know this is the tactic you know CEOs will use with the board right they never they never go into the board meeting or they never want to go into the board meeting cold they always want to meet with a couple the board members first agree what is the outcome they're going to get and then they go into the board meeting be like right this is the direction this is the strategy this is the budget and they've already got a couple of board members on side who are going to be like yeah absolutely this this sounds great okay final thing on tone gosh uh and then I'll try and get around to some questions um leaning into tension I think whenever you come across disagreements then as much as possible You want to interpret that as an opportunity to learn. So you shouldn't be threatened by disagreements. Not always anyway. If someone's like, "That doesn't sound like a very good idea." Rather than sort of jumping to kind of justify yourself and kind of state your reasons more forcefully, it's always a good idea if you can just hold your tongue for a moment and get them to say, understand why they got a different viewpoint. You don't have to agree with them when they've said their piece, but giving yourself that time is going to make them feel heard and it's going to check if you've got any blind spots or you've kind of missed any information. So, a few kind of almost like questions or things you can do to kind of give yourself time and get them talking. Say things like, "Oh, that seems to be really important to you. You know, tell me a bit more." Or, "Hm, that's a bit surprising. You don't say that bit." Say like, "Oh, what leads you to that conclusion." Find your own phrases. These might not sound natural to you um depending on how you speak and who you're speaking to and so on, but find a couple of go-to phrases that you can use that will just buy you that bit of time and get um give you more insight into why people are thinking something different from you. The other thing I'd say is it's really really valuable if you can then kind of summarize back or repeat back what people have told you. And not always you're going to seem like some kind of robot. Um, but when it's really delicate, you know, or when you when they've said something really surprising that maybe you don't quite fully understand, um, then summarizing back is just a powerful way of kind of making them feel heard, checking your own understanding. So, you know, classic things like, "So, what you're saying is blah blah blah," or, "Can I play back what I'm hearing? Can I just check I've understood you correctly?" Right? Again, you don't want to overuse it, but use sparingly. Like everyone's going to appreciate you being like taking the time to understand their point of view. Um, I think this is my final slide. Uh, projecting calm confidence. So, last one, we talked about this a little bit right right at the start. Um, a couple of things here. All right. If most PMs, you know, your job is dealing with uncertainty, right? That's why there is a product manager. If there was no uncertainty, there would be no PM job, right? So, this is a feature of the job. This is not this is not a bug. Um, your job therefore is to help other people navigate uncertainty and it's kind of lead them through that uncertainty. That's really helpful if you stay calm and you focus on the important things and you know, you are kind of a calming influence rather than getting really stressed about stuff. Um I think as well one of the things that can help you lead through uncertainty is having principles having integrity having values. So you know if you don't have data to lead you if you don't have you know um evidence you can say look overall we always try and do like what's best for the customer overall we always try and do what's best for XY Z you know this internal team like where are your your guiding limits like having those kind of principles that you fall back to again makes makes your behavior predictable and that makes it easier for people to understand where you're coming from um to know what you're going to do which makes you more trustworthy. And the other thing I'll say on this is um yeah kind of like it's kind of like doing stuff that's expected is very powerful. So like you know respecting the rituals that the team has and I say that kind of yeah rituals the meetings the cadence whatever the team does. So like understanding that and and building into it, you you can change it, right? You know, you can not necessarily tear everything up, but you know, if you're like, "Oh, actually, I think we should do our standups differently." That's fine. What I'm saying is like you kind of you lean into the kind of the way that things work and the culture. Um because that shows that you you understand them and you respect them. And again, like there's there's a certain way that things happen and people can take comfort in that. I find you we talked to this a little bit like you know just make sure like when you do kind of close interactions or meetings you do that kind of classic thing of like if there are to-dos make sure like the actions like what needs to get done who's going to do it when they're going to do it by the holy trinity of closing meetings. Um, yeah, it really really valuable and it's it's one of those basic things, but it's one of those things that the most senior people I know are actually the best at doing this. And so it's again, it's one of those things that do the basics really really well and goes an awful long way to to kind of um leading. That was it. Wow, that was a little bit longer than expected. I haven't given this talk before. Um, if you have questions, dumb them in the chat. I will answer as many uh as I can. Um, a quick shout out to Hustlebadger. We do lots of great things. If you're looking for more support as a product manager, we have courses on demand live or or live. So, self-s serve or live courses. We have a ton of templates. We do webinars like this. We've got a Slack group you can join. We do inerson workshops. It's all great. If you need any support with being product manager, we are the people. uh to help. Right, Q&A. I'm going to stop sharing so you can see my face a bit more. Uh let's talk about I saw Dippyan put a question in here. When joining a new organization as a senior product leader with no formal authority yet, what are the first signals to actively look for in the first 30 60 days to understand how decisions really get made? Um and how you turn those insights into influence before you build deep relationships. So I think one of the really um useful questions you can ask in an interview as a product manager is yeah how did decisions get made and you know again don't ask in a general generality like that ask you know what is the current strategy who decided the strategy how did or how did that get decided what led you to that strategy it will tell you so much about the dynamics of the company and how things actually work um once you're into a Then usually um you're trying to show that you've got novel insights somewhere that might be you know again you'll be doing it indirectly but do you have some quantitive analysis that you've asked for? Have you looked at the primary insights like you need to immerse yourself in the data somewhat um and then I'd say like within 60 days you really need to be um shipping stuff that has your kind of fingerprints on it somehow. So that can be quite small things right obviously because you haven't had much time but you need to show that you are getting kind of into the weeds and making things happen. Um you can I think like a quick way of sort of showing that you are getting involved is looking at the processes looking at the artifacts that side of things and suggesting improvements there. That's also it's a fairly superficial um way of of demonstrating um yeah how much impact you're going to have. So I think that's it's fine as a stop gap for a week or two like literally a week or two but it's not going to prevent you having to have those insights or actually ship things within you know a month or two. Does that answer your question? Yeah. Thumbs up. Great. Super. Any other questions then? No. Everyone happy? Um, as I mentioned, uh, a few more links in the chat. We'll send links in the chat again. If you want to connect with me on LinkedIn, do happy to answer questions by LinkedIn.

All right, have a great evening everyone. See you all soon. Bye-bye. >> Thank you.
