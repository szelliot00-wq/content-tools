Hi everyone. I am Ed. I'm one of the co-founders of Hustlebatcher and today we're going to talk about growth loops. So just before I get going, um a few bits of housekeeping. Um this is a live session. Please ask questions in the chat. I would be delighted to answer them. Maybe we'll even convince Susanna to answer some questions too because she knows quite a lot about growth loops as well. Um this uh this is being recorded as well and you can find um or you will be able to find a recording of this and all our other webinars on our YouTube channel. Can also sign up for other um uh events like this one on our Luma page and I'm going to drop you a few links in the chat now so you know where to find them. Um, worth mentioning if you haven't come across Hustlebadger uh before then we provide product management and AI training um for people building digital products um and we have a wide range of courses, playbooks, templates and a Slack community um that help you do better at your job basically get promoted um and you know live your best life. So worth checking out our website if you haven't already found it. With that, I'm going to start talking about growth loops. So what is a growth loop? Let's start at the beginning. Um a growth loop is basically a selfreinforcing engine for growth. So it is a as you can see like a loop or a circle um that may have more steps than this depending on how you write it out. Um, but it always has sort of three core steps. Um, even if they're kind of articulated, you know, split out into slightly more um, more steps to make it obvious. So firstly, you're going to have some kind of input, some kind of starting material for growth. So this might be a new user joins your site. I say you know starting material like it's not always a user or sometimes like a user is not the easiest way to think about this because you might think like actually what really drives our growth and you'll see this in some of the examples you know what really drives the growth of Zapia is integrations what really drives the growth of Hustlebadger is you content so it can can be interesting to think about this um in different ways and if this all by the way if this all seems a little bit abstract I'm going to do a ton of examples so don't worry about But I want to show you kind of like what the patterns are. The second thing you'll see then is that starting material, you know, uses your product and by using your product, it kind of creates value, you know, value for for both, you know, the users but also for the business and then that value is then reinvested in generating new inputs. So again is that your users whatever is fueling growth that is then reinvested. Um and this is really the sort of the key point about growth loops is that yeah they are circular they are cyclical. Um, so the outputs feed back into the inputs and whilst it's rare to get growth engines that are kind of completely self-sufficient, you know, sort of u perpetual motion machines of growth, um, the idea is that they they kind of they run for as long as possible with as little amount of input and by doing that they make growth uh much more efficient and much more scalable than it would otherwise be. So as an example um here is what this might look like for Mirro at a very basic level. So you know a user creates a mirror board you know and your mirror board is effectively there your your unit of of input your unit of growth. um they then share that mirror board with others so people can collaborate with them right that is going to you know it's why they're using mirror but also the other users are going to get value there and then by sharing that board uh other people are going to sign up um to Mero so that they can make comments so they can view the board and so on um but also some of them are going to create their own Miro boards and then you're sort of back to the step in the cycle. So this is ofite quite a neat um you know userdriven cycle where your uh each user may well bring in or is is going to bring in other new users as well. So why do we talk about funnels or how do we think about funnels versus loops then you when growth loops started to be talked about which is maybe yeah 8 years ago something like that 8 n years ago um you know a lot of noise was made about how these were completely different for loops but I think in practice they are not that different and I would stress that you don't want to overthink this too much in both cases you are trying to understand what are your growth channels, how does your company grow and how do you increase your your your revenue effectively. The benefit of funnels is that they are very easy in concept. They're very easy to measure the steps and so you can optimize them over time and it's very clear what what what's going on. The benefit of loops though it well the problem with funnels I should say is that um they don't always focus on scalable growth channels. So it's very easy to think of a funnel where actually whatever you get out at the bottom doesn't feed in any way to what goes in at the top. And that means that you can't necessarily scale up your funnel. you can improve it, but you can't make it any bigger. Um, and that's a problem if you have ambitions to be a really big company. If you have ambitions to be a really big company, you want to be able to continue to grow and grow at an ever, you know, larger larger rate. So to be able to do that, you've got to be able to think in terms of scalable growth channels where you can reinvest, you know, what you're getting out of each user or each kind of unit of of growth um to fuel further growth. And and the benefit of growth loops therefore is really that they they have that emphasis on reinvestment um and scalability, but also they they help you break down functional silos. So silos between say product, marketing, sales, operations. Um if you think about funnels, it's very often that you know people will sort of go well the top couple of you know areas that's marketing's role. You know they they're in charge of awareness. They're in charge of like driving traffic to the website and then as soon as people hit the website right that's products you know uh problem product then have to convert them into paying users. Um when you think about a loop, it's um encourages you to think of this as much more of an integrated system where retention, acquisition, monetization are all interconnected and because they're all interconnected, they require a crossunctional approach to tackle them. So that means you have fewer functional silos. You have to work much more um tightly with your your marketing uh partners, your revenue partners and so on. Um but also you think of holistic solutions to what you're trying to do. So um not just building a better product but also thinking about well who is your ICP? What are their needs? How do you make sure that you are attracting the right people? So with that kind of basic definition out the way um I'll run through what are the four main types of acquisition loops that you get. First one is viral loops. So these are loops that are driven by users themselves. You know each user brings in more users. Second is content. So here you are producing uh material that you can share on social media or that you can use to drive SEO and that brings users in. Third one is um paid loops. So here, everyone that joins the the product or signs up to the product is giving you money and you're then reinvesting that money into paid marketing. So that could be straight up performance ads, that could be affiliates, that could be influencer marketing, but it is a a paid channel that you can invest increasing amounts of money in to to give you uh growth. And the fourth one is sales. So similar to to paid here, but instead of um investing in paid channels, you're investing in your sales team, the tooling they have, um the process that they have so that you can drive um increasing number amounts of awareness through your sales team and increasing um you know uh sales closures and and deal closures. Again, let's run through a few examples of these just so it makes sense. And again, if you have questions or or or you you think these um you you don't get it, then please ask me. I I'd say as we go through these, I wouldn't be too kind of hung up on categorizing what the types are. Um because as you'll see like, you know, viral and content start to get a bit blurry and it it doesn't really matter. I think what this this categorization is useful for is when you're thinking about what your channels might be, just recognizing where you're strongest and where you want to focus and then thinking from that sort of like where you could add supplementary loops onto. So, couple of examples of of viral loops. Firstly, Loom. So with Loom, you know, you're doing um short videos that you can share with with colleagues uh to give them updates, explainers, all the rest of it. Then uh first thing that happens is a team member is recording a Loom video, right? So you've got that video, they're then sharing it uh either with their colleagues internally or externally publicly. Those videos, they're really easy to use, really easy to record, and um people love them. So some of those viewers who then see that are going to sign up themselves and realize that they can use it for whatever they need to do to collaborate with other team members. Um so that sends you around the cycle. Second example here, type form. So input a user creates a survey using type form. They then share that with respondents. So however they're finding them um maybe that's their you mailing list, social media, a paid list or whatever it is. Um, some of those forms are going to be Typeform branded and some of those respondents are going to see the survey, they're going to love the the UX and think, "Oh, great. I'll use Type Form for my next survey." And again, you're then going back around the the loop again. We switch over to content. Then, um, Zappy is an example of this in a way. So you're every time that they create an integration in the product um that integration they're then writing up as multiple landing pages you know how do you connect you know Gmail to stripe you know so every time they do another integration they can write up an everinccreasing number of landing pages as they basically say oh we've got 10 existing integrations we can now run up you know 10 of these landing pages um that tell you how to connect to this new uh new service, whatever it is. Each of those landing pages is going to drive um traffic to the website. People are going to find that on Google. They're going to find it in LMS's um and they're then going to come to Zappia. Some of those people are then going to understand, oh, actually this thing I wanted to do that's easiest to do through Zapia. And so they're then going to sign up and create workflows and automations through Zappia, right? Um, and that that sort of um is then going to give people it's going to give Zappy a kind of signal about where they should be building new integrations. They're going to get signal from their existing users. Um, they're going to see which connections, which landing pages people are are landing on. Um, and they can also look at sort of like where is their search volume for different connections as well. Another content example here, Reddit. So you have a user starts a thread um you know asks a question or posts a comment or gives a little like micro blog in a way. Um that thread is then going to draw in traffic from SEO you know as well as attracting traffic from people already on on Reddit. It's going to draw in new people via SEO who are googling similar terms or it's going to draw in people from again you know increasingly from LLMs who are indexing um Reddit and other social media quite highly. people then who see that thread uh might sign up to comment on it or to get notifications um or to sign up to the channel because they want to see more content like that. And then some of those people are going to start writing their own threads and kind of generating um more content uh for for this this this wheel this flywheel. We look at paid couple of examples here but they're quite similar um I guess more more intuitive in a way. Um, so Dualingo, you know, a user arrives from a paid ad, uh, maybe they saw it on Instagram, um, you know, or Tik Tok. Um, they download the app, they go into, uh, Dualingo, um, they use it for a little bit of time and quite quickly they upgrade to a paid version, and that revenue then from the new user is used to fund more ads. So in a paid uh loop like this one then the time between you know how long it takes from a user to sign up to be able to like earn enough money to pay for that investment and the amount of money that they are paying. Those are obviously key variables that you want to understand is like how effective that growth loop is going to be. Similarly um yeah your comm could be very similar loop. So, someone's going to arrive from an ad, they're going to uh sign up to a subscription or certain percentage of those people will sign up to a subscription and that money from subscriptions is then going to fund more ads. Sales side, again, that looks quite similar to paid in many ways. Um, you've got a new customer who's going to be closed by the sales function there. Um, it's obviously going to be a, you know, longer process, more involved process than running B2C ads. uh those customers are then going to drive you know revenue for for Stripe by driving transactions through Stripe and the money that Stripe makes from those transactions they're going to reinvest in the number of sales reps they've got the tooling they've got you know the materials and process that their their sales team have got which is going to drive them more sales further down the line um and a final example here so aptitude similar sort of thing you know new customers closed by the sales function then they're going to pay an annual license um to amplitude for usage you on a per seat basis and that money is going to be reinvested in the sales function as well as in the product right to kind of like increase the amount of functionality and increase the number of use cases served so that then you've got a larger addressable market for the sales team to to function. So, some examples of growth loops there. Um, those were all kind of fairly basic ones just to get you in the idea of um what's going on. And I'll show you how you can build on those uh a little bit later. Um but what I wanted to do was just talk through okay so you're tasked with growing your company or you know thinking about growth actually what are the steps here for using growth loops as a framework to help you think through how you might grow and um you know yeah how you might grow the company. So firstly, there's some kind of prerequisites that you want to make sure you've got in place before you start thinking about growth loops. Once you've got those, um that's primarily retention. Um secondly, um you want to be able to map the customer journey not just in the product but through from the their initial awareness of your product and their decision to uh look into a product for a new solution um for a problem that they've got. So you understand what your value proposition is um what are the triggers um they have for making that purchase. Based on that and just from your kind of understanding of the the company and what your product does, you should be able to define what your primary growth loop is or understand what your your primary growth loop is. And that then puts you in a place where you can optimize your growth loop by looking at how you can how you can optimize all the different steps in it. Um the other thing you can do is then think about how you might extend your growth loop by kind of bolting on additional um sub loops that kind of reinforce the the the core loop. And that's how uh most companies grow as they kind of like they start with a a single primary loop. They make that work really really well. And then if they feel that growth is kind of starting to dip on that primary loop or they want to extend growth even even faster and they've got the resources to do it, they will then look at building on additional loops that kind of support the primary one. So let's look a little bit at each of these steps in turn. So yeah, prerequisites you before thinking about growth, you really need to have um you know decent PMF uh so product market fit or or good retention um because otherwise every new user that you inject into the product is going to turn out quite quickly um and you'll be wasting your time effectively kind of um pouring users uh or like trying to trying to kind of grow the product. So ways you can kind of determine whether you you're ready for growth. Firstly, there's the classic sort of like retention curve that you'll see here on the left. Um and so your retention if this is months after launch or weeks after launch, what you really want to see is something like the blue curve where people join. And even if you get quite a lot of people dropping out quite quickly, what you see is this blue curve kind of stabilizing um to a point where and flattening out so that you've got some users who are sticking around for a long period. If what you're seeing is this something more like this red curve um where actually you know maybe you're not seeing dramatic churn quickly but you are seeing churn go basically to zero you know like very low single digits. Um this isn't really enough. You're not you're just not retaining enough of your users coming in to be able to grow the the company. And this is quite um similar to what you will see even in in the kind of viral breakout hits like uh B real or clubhouse is they will often have like very high um retention initially but it just does not level out and it continues to drop to zero. So that means that they can grow very very fast because they have strong viral loops to start with but because no one sticks around that is just like a wave of users passing through the uh through the product. So it it it grows very quickly but then it also dies off very very quickly. other signals that you might get. Um, you know, do you, you know, if you're doing a PMF survey, um, have you got your classic kind of 40% of people who are saying, uh, yeah, I'd be very disappointed if this product disappeared overnight, or if you've got significant word of mouth, if you're seeing that from um, yeah, your attribution efforts, like when people join the product, a lot of them are saying that they were recommended by other people, or you see a lot of people talking about your product positively. That could be a good indication as well. if you don't have the the data to show you retention. Um, but this really needs to be in place before you go any further. So once you've got that in place, the next thing I would do is then map out the customer journey. Um, because this is going to basically provide you with the kind of the all the ideas and the fuel for for the further steps. So I'd start really like as I say way before people come into contact with the product and think about almost like what is the point where they start to become aware of the problem. Um you know what is the the trigger for them even thinking about this is a problem that needs to be solved like why are they seeking a solution? What makes this a problem like right now? Then I'd have a look at the the channel. Um, so once people know that they've got a problem, um, how do they find out about you? What is the the core message they respond to or what is the, uh, you know, the things they are looking for? Um, then you can look at, you know, when people actually find you and come into contact with the product, what does that look like? So, what does the onboarding process look like? How does the account creation process look like? what are the first few things that they are doing once they get inside the product. Um, I'd look at where people actually get value from the product. So, you know, what are they doing, you know, time after time? What why do they want to use the product? What is the value that they they're getting out of it? And that might not be what you designed it for if you're very early on in your your development. Um, and I look at retention. So if you look at some of those people who are sticking around for a long time, what do they look like? What are they doing you know time after time? What keeps them coming back? And also is there anything that makes them stand out? You know that they did during onboarding that uh or early on in the journey that other people didn't do. So this is often like a really good kind of signal for you know what did people look further up this this journey. So understanding this is going to be um it's really important because when you're then thinking about growth tactics having this kind of like understanding means that you can focus on the people who are most likely to have high retention. But you can also think about, you know, what are the sorts of things you can do that are going to hit people, you know, when they're at this trigger point, when they're at this channel point, and mean that you get kind of like a good flow of people into your into your uh growth loops. I just say in terms of actually doing this then typical ways you'll be doing this are running jobs to be done interviews you going and speaking to people who've just uh made a purchase so that purchase journey is fairly um fresh in their mind you know interviewing people who turned out on the product finding out why it didn't work for them speaking to people who are are kind of strongly retained power users like what is working for them um and then customer journey mapping um when people come into contact with the product as well and just kind of mapping out well actually even in the marketing campaigns and then through into the product like what did that journey look like for them not just in the kind of website or the app or whatever it was but in all the touch points that they had so emails you know marketing campaigns sales rep touches um calls all the rest of it so you understand from a from the customer's perspective how did they find Um does this apply for free products with upsell figures uh features? Yeah, absolutely. Um so you you want to understand like firstly how do people find the product you know and and presumably start using on a free basis and then what made them um decide to upgrade to a a paid plan actually start buying it. Once you've done that, so you then understand your your journey, um you then should have sort of sufficient insights that you can start thinking about what your primary growth leap is. Now, I say like in most cases, this is fairly obvious, right? You know, this is why I asked it in the chat, like what's your what's your kind of biggest growth channel? you know where most of your users are coming from already and that should be a um sort of an ongoing uh channel or a channel that you could keep doing. So if most of your users have come from Product Hunt, that is a problem because that is a one-off thing that is not going to give you users long term. that if most of your users are coming from, you know, your newsletter or um you SEO, that's fine because even if that's only one or two articles or posts that are driving users, you could go and generate more posts, more articles. You can do the research to kind of drive more traffic there. Um see most important here is you want this to be aligned across the company. This isn't something that you can just decide in isolation in the product team um and then work on that basis. This is something where you want to have a like very very transparent and direct chat with sales with marketing. How do they think the company grows? Um where do great leads, great customers come from? Um and how do you measure that? And so the first thing I would do is try and sketch out this this uh loop kind of qualitatively just like what are each of the steps and what might it look like? Um and then I try and put metrics on to measure each of the steps. And this doesn't have to be a kind of super tight um you know x% of this leads to x% of that. I think of this more in terms of if this was a dashboard um what are the numbers you'd want to see to be able to check that everything was working well. So couple of examples here you know if Loom you're thinking about okay well our input is is creators then so we're looking at you know the more creators we get then we should get more videos being created if we get more videos being created we should get more viewers and the more viewers we get we should get more creators right so you should be able to put numbers on each of those and yes you can then kind of track the um the conversion rate from each of these steps to to one another um to establish some baseline of performance, right? So you can then see if things are going to uh improve as you as you change things or not. Another example here, Zappia. So you might have your number of integrations. Every integration you you produce does it like how many landing pages it does it produce for each landing page? How many unique users does it generate? And then you how many um for each the traffic you're getting in, how good are you at converting that into more integrations. So that's effectively like what is the efficiency of your product team. Just a quick note then on K factor as we talk about that because as soon as you get the loop um then I think there's this this kind of like pressure okay what is the K factor of um the the loop and the K factor is kind of defined as you know for each cycle of the loop um how many more in or for each input you put into the loop how many more inputs do you generate so if that's driven by users for each user that goes into the loop how many us new users did they generate Um so that is effectively the efficiency of the loop where if it's greater than one you would get exponential growth right so if every new user is generating one and a half new users then you're going to get an everinccreasing number of new users coming into your uh into your loop. If it's less than one, then theoretically your growth will eventually die out, right? Because every user is only going to bring in, you know, maybe 75 users next time round and that 75 users is only going to bring in like, you know, 49 or.5 of a user the second time round and so on. It's just going to decline away. In reality, um, it's a K factor is I've not found it that useful. um for a few reasons. It's quite hard to measure because when you're looking at um how many people you get at each of these steps, it could be quite difficult to carve out or to attribute like which of those people came from um the previous step because you you will inevitably have like multiple sources of like new users and videos and whatever you're measuring. Um you also it's very unlikely that you get either exponential growth or completely stagnant growth. Um and it's much more typical for companies to have sort of non-exponential but kind of slightly variable growth somewhere in the middle. Um and if you do get it above one um that is usually very very shortlived. So even the most kind of viral products like the classics like Tik Tok and Facebook, if you actually look at like how they grew when they were purely viral, they usually only have a K factor above one for a few months before it kind of drops down again. That said, um you can have a K factor of like less than one and it's still really valuable. Um which is why I think the kind of growth growth loops is a an interesting framework to look at. The other thing about um K factor though is it it's not always like hugely actionable because because there's no sort of like higher is obviously better. Um but because it can be valuable even when it's below one um it's not necessarily kind of telling you a lot that you don't get from looking at the kind of the components of the the conversion rate from each step. Okay. So you've defined your steps, you've kind of quantified them somehow in some kind of metric. Um then you you there's sort of three questions you want to be asking yourself. So how do you maximize your impact of each step? So how do you kind of like make each step just bigger on absolute levels? How do you minimize the friction between steps? So how do you increase the kind of the conversion rate between steps? And then how do you increase the speed of the loop? So how do you sort of uh reduce the time going around the loop? because each of these things will um increase your growth rates, right? All other things being equal. So again, like taking Loom as an example, um can you get each creator to post more videos? Um can you get more views on each video? Can you reduce the time to creating a video? It's effectively like those three questions. And if those are the questions you're trying to answer, this work that you've done to map the customer journey, to understand the consu customer problem, to understand the alternatives, you know, your value proposition, all that work you did in kind of mapping the customer journey, that is what's going to give you some ideas here of what you can do. Um I talked I kind of mentioned briefly about extending your growth loops and this is an example of what that might look like. Um again this this is still simplified but I'll I'll kind of show you how this works. So if we look at an example like eventbrite here they've got a loop where their basic loop is uh they have a creator create an event that person then shares the event um you know social media email however they they do it um they sell tickets people then attend their event and some of those people might sort of see uh Eventbrite as a platform where they can host their own events and be like okay great I'll launch my next event But this loop they can then augment or build on not by creating completely separate loops but sort of creating additional paths that reinforce um the primary one. So by putting by optimizing their event pages for SEO, they're going to draw in new people to events. So then when a creator creates an event, it's not just people who the creator uh marketed to. It's also going to be other people who the creator didn't know about, but Eventbrite drew to those event pages that might end up buying tickets. So that's that's obviously like great for creators, great for Eventbrite because the more people they draw in, the more creators they might get. And similarly, like you might have something like paid acquisition. So when um tickets get sold, you know, Eventbrite itself makes money. Some of that money can be p put into paid acquisition and again that's then going to be put into uh driving new creators who are going to create more events. So again, I've just done sort of two kind of little um additional loops on here, but the idea here really is that you you don't need to be recreating this whole loop. And um you probably don't want to be creating loops that are completely separate from your core loop. Like if you've got a loop that's working really really well, like first you want to focus on that primary growth loop. That is the sort of like number one thing. Once you've got that working really well, then you might want to think about these additional loops to kind of like get it going a bit a bit um better. So, that was a quick kind of like intro to growth loops. Um I'm happy to answer any questions in the chat, but uh again, for those of you not familiar with Hustlebger, just a quick kind of shout out for us. Um, as I say, we we support product managers and digital builders of all stripes. Um, with our courses, templates. We've got a wiki full of case studies, playbooks, and examples. Um, we do regular webinars like this one. And we also have a a Slack channel and run uh workshop, yeah, private workshops for uh people's companies as well. With that, I'll open it up to questions if there are any. Got any tips for tools to measure growth loops and keep track of sources? um you I mean generally your whatever your product instrumentation is is going to be useful for this but I think what you know again going back to that point that a lot of your growth loops will be cross might be cross functional. So if your growth loop is sort of creating blog pages or creating content then how like where you create that content the impressions it gets like that might be not on your platform or not on your website. So I think about like what is your loop first and then think about where do you need to get information from. Um you might be all be able to get all of that from amplitude or or something like that. You might have to stitch together different data sources to come up with an integrated uh dashboard. Tim I saw you asked another question earlier. How long should you try growth via a certain channel before you abandon it or would you recommend betting on multiple channels in parallel? So um usually what I do is understand what is going to be your major growth uh mechanism like is that going to be paid you know sales uh content viral like those major categories and then I test like lots of different tactics within that category and see what sticks and you basically want to optimize for learning and exper and experimentation until you see one tactic that's working like much better than everything else. Then once you've got that, you want to double down on that growth lever and push that as hard as possible. So the it's not you it's going to be hypothesis driven like where you make those bets because every bet is going to take time. It's going to take effort. Some of them are going to take you know quite a bit of time not just to kind of build and set up but to see if they they pay off. Um, but you want that those bets to be driven by your hypothesis of what's going to work based on the uh interviews that you've done and your understanding of the customer journey. Did that. Any other questions then before we wrap up? All right then. Well, thanks very much everyone.
