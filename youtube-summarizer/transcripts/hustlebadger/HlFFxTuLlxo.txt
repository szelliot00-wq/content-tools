Hey everyone, I am the co-founder of Hustlebadger and very lucky to have with us here today Jacob Bank who is the CEO of uh Relay um which is a agent building platform and something that that uh you know I'm personally uh a big fan of. So most of this talk is going to be Jacob telling us what agents are, how to build agents, how they can make our lives better. Um but I did just want to give a quick shout out about Hustlebad to explain what we do. We do super practical training on AI skills and on product management. We have a bunch of both on demand skills that you uh you know courses, wikis, templates that you can use self-s serve as well as a number of uh on demand live cohort courses which I'll say a little bit more about later. Um but we are running um these talks on a weekly basis uh where we pull in experts from across the industry to teach you super practical skills. So I will drop a few links in the chat as we get going. I'm going to link to Jacob's LinkedIn because he posts like a ton of really great content on there. Um to uh the Hustlebger YouTube, the Relay YouTube which has got a bunch of great um tutorials on it as well. Um, and you know, a whole bunch of other useful stuff. Um, let me not waffle on too long, boring, because you're here to listen to Jacob. You're here to learn about agents. Um, Jacob, over to you. >> Let's do it. So, hey everyone. My name is Jacob. I'm the founder of Relay App. Don't but don't worry, this talk is not an ad for my product in particular. This talk is going to be designed to get you to think about team building in a new way. Um, in the world in which we have a small number of human employees managing large teams of AI agents, that is the future of work for all of us. Some of us are there already. Some of us will be there in months. Everyone will have to be there in 2 to 3 years because that is what knowledge work is is going to look like. And so what I want to teach you today are some basic principles that you can use to think about what tasks AI can do for you. how to think about the job descriptions and the organizational chart of AI agents that you want and then how to actually build those and teach them to be useful for you. Uh so I'm going to include a few slides and then I'll do a live demonstration portion. The live demonstration is going to be of unlaunched product features that you are going to be the first 70 people to see. So I'm really excited to to to get get your feedback on that. And I'll be monitoring the chat as we go. So please jump in with questions, comments, feedback so we can make it make it interactive. With that, let's dive in. Can everyone see my screen? Great. >> Yes, we can. >> Okay. So this is the future. Like I just mentioned, every company that does knowledge work where people are doing things on a computer will have a small number of human employees and then a very large team of AI employees supporting those human employees and giving them leverage. I know this is the future because I'm already living it. The way we're building related app as a company would not have been possible even a year ago. We have quite a small team of people only 10 given the size of our customer base and and the sophistication of our product and a large team of AI agents over 300 now supporting us. We have no employees in marketing, sales, support, success, HR, finance, recruiting, operations and several other job functions that most companies of our size have either a full-time person or a full-time team in. And all of these functions are teams of AI agent managed by me. So I am I am all of those departments at our company. The other nine people at the company are the engineers, designers, and product people building building the product. Um, for example, here is our actual marketing org chart. It's going to be a bit hard to see the slide, but I can share a more zoomed in version after, but you can see that this this marketing org chart is divided by channel. We have community and education, email marketing, LinkedIn, Reddit, SEO, YouTube, uh, uh, X, Twitter, and then our our webinar motion. And you can see in each of those categories, there are anywhere between three and 10 AI workflows or agents that are performing those tasks. And I'll I'll go into some detail later in some of the ones that we actually use to give you an idea of what might be possible for you. But this is our real marketing org chart. This is our support org chart. You can see that we've divided our support org chart into the phases of the support journey. The main bulk of these workflows are in directly replying to user questions. But we also want to track support load across people. Uh summarize the major support themes coming up in a given day. We want to triage the support issues that get through into bugs or feature requests. We want to do some automatic, you know, management of longstanding bugs or issues that need to be cleaned up. We use AI to help us do planning. So AI plans our frontline support rotations and our on duty rotations and it reminds people of when their rotation is coming up and proactively suggest swaps if people are, for example, going to be on vacation. And then last but not least, the AI agent automatically follows up with the customer once we've addressed an item. So there's our support chart. And here's my executive assistant. My executive assistant is actually a set of AI workflows that handle specific tasks for me. For example, I get a briefing before every meeting telling me who that person is and sharing summary of our previous correspondents. The after every meeting, I have a follow-up email drafted to the other participants. I have a Slack message sent internally to our company. If people have not RSVPd yet for a meeting, they get a reminder from me 3 hours before. If I have an unusually late or early meeting or an important conflict in the upcoming day or week, I will get a notification about that to do something about it. And then this is the one sick day. I don't know if you can see this here, sick day. This is the one I added recently, which is I have three little kids and one of them is often sick. And so I I created a little sick day automation that all I have to do is send the words sick day to Slack and my AI assistant will send a polite note to everyone I'm scheduled to meet with later that day saying, "I'm so sorry, my kid is sick. I'll be in touch to reschedule our our our meeting." I also have some help with email and test management. But this is this is the idea. I've thought about team building and the way I orchestrate my work in a totally different way to how I would have two to three years ago. Two to three years ago, the default for a founder CEO of a company with our scale would have been to hire an executive assistant either in person or a virtual assistant. But in the world of AI agents, I decided to design and create my own because all of this is knowledge work that can happen directly in my email, my calendar, my task list, etc. So, what is an AI agent? And I'm going to give you the definition of AI agent that I find useful. There are like 11 at least different versions of AI agents. Everyone is calling their product an AI agent. O OpenAI is calling their browserbased automations an agent. Air Table is calling their little co-pilot an agent. Everyone's calling everything in their products an agent. But I'm going to tell you what I mean by an agent in the context of building your your team in a different way. So, first I want to set a foundation that there are three modalities that I've seen that I'm using AI through every day and that I think everyone else either is or should be. The first on the far left is a chatbot. I'm 100% sure that every single person on this call has used a chatbot. Everyone has gone to chatbt and typed in some research questions or given it uh an email draft to give feedback on. We know what a chatbot is. It's an interactive synchronous textbased conversational experience where we use AI as a thought partner or a researcher or refiner of our ideas. That's a chatbot. Of the 84 people on this call, I bet at least 75% have used a co-pilot. A co-pilot is an AI experience that lives on top of or inside of a different productivity tool and helps you create artifacts or analyze information in that tool. For example, if you've used Lovable or Bolt or Vzero or Figma Make to create a website, that's a co-pilot because there's a 20% chat experience on the left side of the screen where you're talking to the AI, but then the main bulk of what's happening, the 80% of the screen is the website that is being created or the prototype that's being created. Gamma is another example of a co-pilot where you have an AI assistant to generate a slide deck. Uh cursor is an example. If you're a coder, you've used the cursor IDE. That's a co-pilot that helps you write code. So, you know you're in a co-pilot if the main focus of the screen is the thing that you're making, the code, the slide deck, the website, the Excel spreadsheet, the air table base, the notion page, and then there's some AI experience that lives to the side of it or on top of it that helps you get that work done. That's co-pilot. Chatbots and co-pilots are amazing. I don't want to make this next point in to to poo poo chatbots or co-pilots or to to diminish the huge impact they've had on work. They're amazing. In many cases, chat bots are multiplicatively more valuable than their predecessor of Google search or AI enhanced co-pilots like cursor are many times better than previous software development environments. But they still have the same fundamental mental model of traditional productivity tools. You type in a URL in your browser, figma.com, chatgbt.com, whatever.com, and you go to that place and you do work. So, you would not think of a chatbot or a co-pilot as a teammate or an employee. They are still just a tool. They're AI enhanced. They're amazing, but they are still traditional productivity tools in the sense that you are sitting down at your desk doing work and you go to those tools to get something done. An agent is fundamentally different. An agent works on your behalf on its own. So you should think of an agent not as a place where you go to do work but a doer of work. And this is where the mental model becomes more like an employee, a teammate, a contractor, an agency that you would hire to do work for you than a productivity tool that you would go to visit. AI agents do work on your behalf on their own. And so if you're deciding what type of AI tool to use to help you with a given responsibility that you have at work, here's how you know you want an agent. All three of these things should be true for you to choose an agent. Number one, the agent is proactive. It should wake up on its own to do work. You do not need to go to a website to type something in to activate your agent. It should do work on its own proactively. Number two, it should be integrated directly into your tools. You should not have to copy and paste something from cashbt into a Google doc. The agent should be able to automatically write the Google doc for you or draft the email for you or update the calendar event for you or enrich the lead in your CRM for you. And number three, this is the most important part. Is it repeated? Does the agent need to do this many, many times over days, weeks, and months? And do you expect it to get better each time it does it? If you have something that's proactive, integrated, and repeated, designing an AI agent is likely the right tool for the job. If these things are not true, you should probably just use a chatbot or a co-pilot. So, a common thing people come to me and say is like, should I use an AI agent to write my PRD for this feature that I'm only doing once ever? No. No, that's not the juice is not worth the squeeze to use an agent for a one-off textbased interactive task. just use a chatbot for that or use your favorite, you know, chat PRD, your favorite your your favorite co-pilot tool. You should think about an agent when you think like, oh, I really wish I could hire a Reddit focused marketer that would automatically look in the relevant subreddits and do sentiment analysis for me and comment when relevant. That is the kind of thing that you want an agent for because it needs to be proactive, integrated, and repeated. And so that's what makes an agent have the mental model that's more like a teammate, an employee, or a contractor than like a traditional productivity tool. Does that all make sense? Any questions so far? >> You've got one question here just asking about uh security and how you handle that giving access to different platforms for agents. To complete the mental model, you should think of an AI agent in the same way you think of hiring a human employee. And so if you've ever worked with a virtual assistant, you know that you need to give your virtual assistant access to your email and calendar because that's the only way that your virtual assistant can possibly triage your emails for you and create your calendar events for you. If you hire a new ta teammate to your marketing team and you want them to be able to write Slack messages and create Google Docs and uh update your CRM, you need to give them access to do those things too. So in general, you should think about anywhere you want your AI agent to do work on your behalf, you need to give them access to the right tools. That could either be through giving them access to your credentials for those tools or it could be creating a dedicated agent account. We've seen customers do both of those, which are there are different scenarios in which you might use one technique or another. The simplest is just to give the agent access to your tools and have it work on your behalf. But if you work in a larger organization, it may make sense to give create like a dedicated account for the agent so you can control exactly what it has access to. That might be different from what what I have access to. Now, I think there's a huge um misconception, I don't want to say misconception, that's too harsh. I think people are spending their energy focused on the wrong security and privacy problems in in in in in my from my perspective. I do think that trust in AI agents is the fundamental reason they're not more adopted today. We can't trust them to do good work on our behalf. Um, when I deal with customer security and privacy questions, I always get these questions that are like, is OpenAI training models on my data? No, they're not. Is my data housed in some specific locality? Maybe it is, maybe it isn't. Um, are you going to get hacked? and an AI agent is going to and because my AI agent has access to my email, the hacker is going to get access to everything. I think these questions are all largely irrelevant. Um, uh, no, OpenAI is not training on your data, but even if they were, that's not a real security vector for most companies. Yes, there's always a risk that a SAS company can get hacked, but that's been true of every SAS company since the beginning of the time, beginning of time. And there are very very few meaningful SAS hackings that have actually spilled confidential data in a way that did any business harm. So that's not something to be worried about. Data locality is a whole separate separate question that I that is certainly not uh driving more more more security unless you're in a very specific regulated industry and you need to be under some legal jurisdiction. So I would ignore all of those questions. Every vendor in our space whether it's Relay, Zapier or Make I would trust all of them with my personal email data even our competitors. Um, and so that's not the angle through which I should I would think about security and privacy. The angle I would think about is what are the things a human employee could do that would be problematic with data. Well, they could email some sensitive information to the wrong customer. That happens all the time. All the time. Anyone who's worked in a large company has had an experience where an employee sent in an email to the wrong person. Happens all the time. But more so when you're in the early days of training your AI agent, because AI agents are so powerful and they can send thousands of emails at once, whereas a human can typically only send, you know, one or two emails at once. It's very possible that an AI agent can send a thousand emails to the wrong people. And so that's not so much a security and privacy issue in the sense of like do they have sock 2 compliance or are they going to get hacked. It's more like if you give your AI agent bad instructions and it doesn't do the task well, it can create very problematic situations. And I'm going to talk in a moment about a couple techniques that you can use to build trust in your AI agent, whether it's making uh the your instructions to it more deterministic and also adding a human in the loop before highstake action. So that's if I were you, that's what I would worry about. Could my AI agent send a thousand emails to the wrong person? I wouldn't worry about, you know, will Zapier get hacked and my email data will be published. That's just not a a relevant concern for most companies. Any other questions? Okay, I see a couple of follow-up questions here. Um, if you have IT teams who do not agree with my perspective, um, here's what I recommend. I'm going to show you a bunch of examples where you can create valuable AI agents that work only based on public data. They don't need access to your email. They don't need access to your CRM. They don't need access to your customer data. They're just going to look at public information on social media, public information on the web, and do really useful things for you. And so, whenever I run into a pro a troublesome IT team, that's what I always start with. Just start using public data. Don't ask for internal access to any systems. Build confidence that this thing is actually valuable. And then you'll have the political capital and the business case to go through the IT uh procurement procurement process. But ultimately like IT teams are going to have to get with the program because businesses are either going to adopt AI in a meaningful way or they're not going to exist anymore. And so hopefully you have forward thinking leaders who are going to help like um give you some air cover to adopt AI tools. And if you don't feel free to introduce them to me and I'll try to I'll try to nudge them in in in the right direction. Um, isn't the some some of the friction caused by people who believe there are right and wrong answers versus probably Yeah, Brent, this is a really good point, which is that's an example of the trust problem I'm mentioning where it's like, I'm not sure the AI agent is going to give me the right answer every time. I'm not sure it's going to give the answer exactly as I would. And I'll show you a couple techniques that you can use to make your agent more reliable and and and more trustworthy. Any other questions before we move on? Okay, let's keep going. So, let's say you're now excited. You're excited about this possibility of having a bunch of AI teammates working with you and helping you. What do you do? The first thing that I would recommend that you do is probably the first thing you do when you are hiring a new person to your team is you write a job description. And now when I say job description, I'm not talking about has a bachelor's of science from a university and has 8 years of C++ experience. Not that kind of job description. I'm talking about a taskoriented job description. What is this teammate person or AI agent going to do for you? And now I want to show you how to write a simple and highquality AI agent job description that is going to make it very easy for that AI agent to do good work on your behalf. Here's what a job description includes. Super simple. Number one, what is the title of your AI agent? Reddit marketing assistant, competitive analyst, user researcher, support triager, whatever, some two, threeword job title of the function you want them to play in your company. And then you give them responsibilities. Responsibilities are the tasks you want your AI agent to do. I typically recommend giving a single agent three to four responsibilities because my general preference is to have a large number of small and manageable AI agents rather than a small number of large agents. But that's a personal a personal style choice. You can have 10 responsibilities if you want. You can have 100 responsibilities if you want. You could have just one responsive if you want. But what I find in most real world situations where I'm working with customers, a good AI agent has three to four responsibilities. How do you write a responsibility? A good responsibility. A good responsibility is written as what, when, how, what do you want the agent to do, when should they do it, and how should they do it? This is probably going to be a little bit more prescriptive than you'd write in the job description for a senior human teammate. It's more like the job description you write for a junior human teammate. For example, if you were hiring a virtual assistant, you would probably write a responsibility that's like, triage my emails. Every time an email comes in, look in my CRM to see if it's an important customer, and if so, apply an important label. That's a what, when, how articulation of that responsibility. The reason this what, when, how articulation is so important is because each responsibility that we write in our AI agents job description is going to become an AI workflow in our tool of choice, whether it's Relay or Zapier or Make or NAN. And if you've used any of those automation and workflow tools, you know that they typically work in a trigger action mental modality where the trigger is when determines when the AI should wake up and do work and then the remaining steps, the actions are the how. And so by writing your responsibility as what, when, how, what you've done is created a very nice zero state prompt for creating the workflow that will that will um execute on that responsibility. Does that make sense? I'll show you a few examples to make it to make it more concrete. What? Follow up after meetings when when a meeting ends. How? Use AI to review the transcript and draft a follow-up email. This is a well-crafted responsibility. It's not rocket science. This is not like some super complex 500word prompt. It's what, when, how. Each of those is, you know, 3 to 10 words. Follow-up after meetings. When a meeting ends, use AI to review the transcript and send a follow-up email. Another example, what? Analyze YouTube videos. When when a competitor posts a new YouTube video, how use AI to analyze it and send a summary to Slack. Again, it's like it's stupidly simple, but this I promise you when you articulate a bunch of responsibilities in this what, when, how format, you'll see that combined they can do really amazing amazing things for you. So, those are two examples of of responsibilities. what, when, how. Always think what, when, how. Now, what I want to do is I know a lot a lot of people on the call are product managers or have roles related to product management. So, I'm going to show you six examples of agents that every PM should have. And for each agent, I'm going to have a job description with the title and then four responsibilities. And each of those responsibilities is going to be written as what, when, how. Number one, an executive assistant. what triage emails, how, when, when I receive an email, how, analyze whether I need to reply and label. I'm not going to read all these out, but an executive assistant should do email triage. It should create meeting briefings for you. It should draft meeting follow-ups for you, and it should remind you of important tasks that you've missed. So, again, let's look at the what, when, how of task reminders every day. Identify tasks that I was supposed to do today that I've forgotten to do or haven't finished, and then remind me via Slack. What, when, how. That's the executive assistant. Number two, the competitive analyst. It should track your competitor's pricing every month, every week. It should summarize all the major launches from your competitors. Every month or every quarter, it should go to neutral review sites, whether it's G2 or Reddit, and scan for people talking about your competitors, pulling out quotes, pulling out sentiment. And then finally, it should analyze which customers your competitors are targeting based on case studies they're announcing, customer quotes they're highlighting, things they're posting on social media. And again, every single one of these job descriptions or excuse me, these responsibility descriptions is a very simple what, when, how. Look at the last one. Every month, scan the competitor's website for reference customers and case studies. Analyze those with AI and then send me a report. That's the number two, the competitive analyst. Number three, social media marketer. Track mentions of your brand. Repurpose content automatically from your YouTube or from your LinkedIn to other channels. Research top performing content in your niche. This has been like the single biggest unlock for our business. Figuring out what people are talking about in the AI space that is generating a lot of attention and then adding our unique perspective on it. And then number four, this is something I was scared to do for a long time. I was like, I could never write the same post again. I could how how terrible would that feel to write the same post again? Everyone is going to be so mad at me recycling old content. Turns out no one remembers. Even if they do remember, they're probably happy to see it again because they had forgotten about it. And so the simplest thing you can have a social media marketer do is just look at your best post from over 6 months ago and recycle them. Um, and so these are the kinds of responsibilities you can give to your third agent, your social media marketer. Number four, a data analyst. I bet you, how many people do we have on the call now? Let's see, 90ome. Um, I bet you every single person in your job at some point you write an email that's like weekly metrics report about something. It could be about activation data, it could be about churn data, it could be about sales data, it could be about um uh customer targeting, could be based on geography, whatever it is, you should be using an AI agent as your data analyst to write these weekly reports for you to alert you to any changes in important metrics to benchmark how your metrics compare to others. Like, hey, we just did some research today that 59% of our revenue comes from the US and 41% of the rest of the world. Is that normal? Are we doing roughly the right thing? are we do we have some huge gap that's making it hard for the rest of the world to buy our product doing competitive benchmarking is super timeconuming but very easy for an AI agent and then last uh thing that I'd recommend for all PMs is customer profiling reviews your successful customers automatically and figure out what industries are they in what's the company size do they have who works with them uh etc that was number four I believe number five uh every PM that I've ever worked with has said I wish we had a dedicated use your research to help us I wish we had enough resour sources for a dedicated user research researcher to help us. Again, this is a situation where you can design your own AI agent that is your user researcher every day. It can synthesize support tickets for you to highlight usability issues every day. It can scan any online forums for what people are organically saying about your product. If you have a structured user interview motion, it can review all those customer interviews and write a report that includes sentiment, key quotes, etc. And then last but not least, you can have your user researcher review all upcoming PRDs and make sure to note which user feedback it would address or or or address. And number six, last but not least, the project manager. Every PM I've ever worked with says, "Oh, I'm so frustrated. So much of my job has become project management. I want to be doing product management, yet I find myself doing so much project management." Well, then delegate the project management to an AI agent. You can have your AI agent write weekly status reports. You can have it notify you or others when bugs or issues are overdue. You can have it automatically log the action items from all of your meetings and follow up. And you can have it create really cool burndown charts or analytics of project progress. So if you're a PM or even if you're not a PM, I hope these six specific agents gave you some ideas of things that you might want to to delegate to uh AI. So now what I want to do is we've got about half an hour left, a little half an hour left. Let me pause quickly there for questions and I want to show you live how to build one. Any questions? >> Let's look at how we build them. >> Let's do it. Okay. So, I'm going to show you now is not yet available in related app or any other product. Uh but I think uh you'll see why why it's why it's cool and it'll be available soon and you'll you also see how you can adapt to the existing tools. Okay, can you all see my reload app screen? What I'm going to do in this demonstration is I'm going to create an executive assistant which is an agent that's general to pretty much anyone who has meetings and emails. And here's what I'm going to do. First, I'm going to click click create agent. The first thing I'm going to do is create the job description of that AI agent. And I know I want uh a personal assistant. So, I'm going to click personal assistant. I could also click other. And then I could just write from scratch. So, I'll click other. And I I'm going to say I want you to be my executive assistant. I'm not really big on personified names, so I'm just going to call it executive assistant. And now I'm going to give it responsibilities. And each of those responsibilities is going to be a what, when, how triage my emails. When a new email comes in, decide whether I need to reply, add appropriate label, daily briefings. Every morning, look at all of my meetings for the day and write me a Slack message summary. Call out any important meetings. And number three, task reminders every day. Look at my Oh, let's just do those. Let's just do those two two for now. I ran into the limits of this text box. We got to make that bigger. Okay. Now I'm going to hit create agent. And so now I'm in a view where I'm interacting with this agent. You can see that I can reference the job description I created. And now it's time for me to make that first workflow. And so to make that first workflow, what I'm going to do is I'm going to click new skill. And that's going to take me into the workflow builder. that may be familiar to you if you've already used related app or zap year or maker or n and all I'm going to do is copy the exact what when how responsibility articulation I created and I'm going to make that the zero state prompt in my workflow creation. So, I'm going to say triage emails. When a new email comes in, use AI to determine whether I need to reply. If so, add the to reply label. I'm going to hit enter. So, what this co-pilot is going to do, remember this is a co-pilot because it's an inproduct AI experience that helping that's helping us build the workflow. What this co-pilot is going to do, it's going to analyze my articulation of the responsibility and it's going to translate that into an AI workflow. You can see that it set up a trigger when an email is received. Then in step two, it set up an AI step that's going to read that email and determine whether it needs a reply. And then number three, it's working on the step to add the two reply label. It's looking, you can see on the left, it's looking through my label corpus to see if I have a two reply label. And it's saying, ah, I almost finished, but I couldn't quite find the right label in your Gmail label corpus. You see where it says labels required. So now what I need to do is I need to manually go in and say, yeah, the label I want in this case is to reply. And so I can now review the work that the co-pilot has done. It's going to trigger whenever an email is received. It's going to triage that email. This, you can see this is a super simple prompt. Given the following email, doesn't require a reply. You could make this repro prompt more involved if you want to over time as your AI gets better. If you're when you're using an AI step in the context of a workflow, I want to show you two things that are super important. You've all written prompts in chatbt. You may not have written prompts in the context of a workflow. The prompt box is exactly the same, but there are two very important differences. When you're using an AI step in the context of an automated workflow, the AI needs to reason about what data it's using to make that decision, which typically comes from earlier on in the workflow, and then what it wants to do with the result of that data. So, you can see here where it says AI has access to the email. That means we've given the AI access to the email that triggered this workflow for it to make this decision. And you can see the output is going to be a yes or no whether a reply is required and a reason. Now I see that the co-pilot has done something a little bit wrong here which is it's going to apply that to reply label no matter what. So I need to tell it only add the label if we need to reply. don't add it if we don't. This is the same way you'd train an executive assistant that's working for you in the context of your real job. If they're using the two reply label too aggressively, you would tell it only only use the the the label when it's actually replying. Okay, so let's see if um the AI agent can fix this. I think we just switched it to cloud 4.5 sonnet, so it might not be able to handle this. Let's say add a path. I'm going to give it a little more guidance on how to how to do this. So I gave it a little hint which says add a path which is going to help you figure out whether you need to add the label or not. And now the AI is confirming to me it added some conditional logic after the AI triage step that only if the reply is needed do we want to add the to reply label. If to reply was not if the AI did not find that we need to reply, we don't add the label. So now I've created my first workflow for triaging emails I need to reply to. If I go back to my executive assistant, you can see that my executive assistant now has one skill that's currently off, but I can flip it to on. I could test it. I won't go through that now because uh I want to show you another one as well. Okay, so now I have a first skill. Now I want to get a second skill, daily briefing. So again, I'm writing a what, when, how prompt, but with a little more detail in the how. every morning. Look up all my uh oh, look up all my meetings for the coming day. Meetings are events, guests, and write me a detailed daily briefing and send it to me as a Slack message. Be sure to call out any important meetings. Let's see if the co-pilot can translate this what, when, how description of the responsibility into a detailed workflow. You can see that the co-pilot has created the plan of what it's going to do. Trigger every morning, find all the meetings, filter to just those with guests, identify and highlight important meetings, summarize them, and send them in Slack. I can answer some questions while we watch it work. >> Yes, we got a couple of questions in the chat. Someone's asking um if this will your previous automation would work with Outlook and how does it work with the the password and security restrictions. >> Yeah. So the email services that related app supports are Gmail and Outlook. And the way you connect your Gmail and Outlook is via OOTH. So you'll go to uh we have a screen in settings where you can manage your connections. You'll log in to a an Outlook provided screen with your Outlook credentials. never put your Outlook credentials into into another app. You'll get a pop-up from Outlook that says, "Log with your credentials. Do you want to give Relayapp access to your email?" And then you'll have the same kind of third party ooth access that you've probably set up with other products in in the past. Okay. So now you can see that the AI finished this workflow. It's first looking at my primary calendar. It's finding the events on that primary calendar. It's generating a daily briefing and let's see uh the Slack window and then it's going to send it to me as a DM in Slack. Let me walk through this a little more slowly. It's going to trigger every day at 8 a.m. Pacific time. If I want that to be at 6 a.m. Pacific time, I can modify it either by uh changing the workflow in the flow builder directly or I could say actually do my daily briefings the night before. Then it's going to find the relevant events that match that time window. You can see now it changed the briefing to to to 6 p.m. Now it's going to find the events that match the date. And now I'm going to now you can see that the events it's going to find are those with guests on the same day. But now because I'm doing the briefing the night before, make sure you find events for tomorrow. Because if we're doing the daily briefing for the night before at 6 PM, I want to find the events for tomorrow. So, you can see now it has updated the find event steps. Everyone see where it says plus one day there? It's a little subtle, but it says I've updated your find events step to look for the events the next day. Then, it's going to use those events to write the daily briefing. It's going to write a nice notification and then send it to me over Slack. So now again if I go back to my agent view I can see that it has these two particular skills. Now what I want to do is I'm going to show you how it actually does does a run. I'm just going to replace this quickly with my primary calendar. Uh do I have any sensitive meetings that I don't want people to see? N I think it's okay. Um I'll just uh say this is daily briefing. Let's do a test run. So, it found two events tomorrow. Tomorrow is a holiday in the US. So, I I hope I don't have too many events because my my kids are off school. So, it found two events. Now, it's going to write a daily briefing and send it to me over Slack. This will probably take like 30 seconds, but don't worry. Um, when your AI assistant is doing this behind the scenes, you won't know that it takes 30 seconds because you'll just get it showing up in your box. Okay, so let's see. It wrote in the daily briefing. says, "Okay, I've got my team meeting in the morning. Yurun's the MC. It's a recurring meeting. Yurun's going to Ty is going to do a backlog review, blah blah blah, and then I have a quick meeting with one of our um one of our users. Overall summary." This is like a pretty decent daily briefing. I could, of course, go through and adjust the prompt to to make it better. Now, if I go back to my agent view, I can see here's the recent work that my assistant did on my behalf. It said the daily briefing for for November 25th. And so as you build up your agents and do they they do more work for you over time, you can see here's the work they're going to be doing for you. You can see whether the workflows are on or whether they're off. And then you can see all of the past work they've done for you. Now, I want to show you one more thing. Let's say you don't know yet exactly how to Oh, what did I do here? Let me refresh. If you don't know exactly how to articulate your workflow as a what, when, how responsibility, the agent can help you figure that out. So, I'm going to show you quickly how to do that. Uh, oh, shoot. Um, give me one second. The Remember how I told you that feature was unlaunched? My feature flag resets every day, so I have to turn it back on. Just give me one moment. Feel free to ask questions in the chat while I'm fixing this. >> Yeah. So, there's maybe I can read out one of these. Um, yeah. I think I think one one popular question that that's come up a couple of times is, you know, how would you compare Relay against Zapia, make uh N, you know, some of these other agent platforms that people will have heard of? >> Yep. Um in general the primary axis of differentiation is how much technical expertise is required to succeed in the product and there's basically a spectrum from relay on one side to nad on the other side. So, if you really want an open-source product that you can contribute new integrations to, if you want to self-host it in your infrastructure, if you're very comfortable parsing JSON objects and writing custom code and making your own HTTP requests, NAN is a good choice for you. NAN is the best tool in the category for technical teams. If you are a less technical user and want to have a simpler and easier to use experience, we've tried to build relay to be on the far opposite side of of the spectrum. So, think of a spectrum between relay and naden. Um, if you have a more conservative company that wants the no one got fired for buying IBM product, Zapier is a great and safe choice. They have the most integrations. They've been in the market for the longest. They have a wellexecuted product. It's decently easy to use. It's easier to use than NN, not quite as easy to use as Relay, but it's a solid product and it integrates with everything. If you want Zapier, but a little bit cheaper and more flexible, you should probably choose Make though. Make actually just made a change to their pricing. So, I'm not sure if that that holds anymore. In general, I'm seeing a harder I'm seeing a harder justification for recommending Make right now because I think Make is kind of trapped in between Zapier and and Naden. If you want all the integrations and the stable enterprise brand, go with Zapier. If you want the technical flexibility and the super low price from self-hosting, choose Naden. Then those are kind of in the traditional automation players. Then if you want a modern agent builder along the lines of relay.app and you really want to build a team of AI agents, you should also consider relevance and Lindy. Relevance, Lindy, and and Relay are three products I think you should consider. We've tried to make relay the easiest to use for basic tasks. Relevance enables you to do some more complex multi- aent coordination than we currently enable. And Lindy has some extra features like voice agents um and uh there was and they also have their own sort of like vibecoded app builder. So they have sort of a bigger a bigger feature scope. But really all of these products have either a generous free tier or a generous free trial. So, what I re recommend doing is take a specific job description of an agent you want to build, like this executive assistant. Go to Relay, go to Lindy, go to relevance, go to make, go to NNN, go to Zapier. Just try to build out one workflow. And if you can't do it in 15 minutes, start with Relay, of course. No, start with whichever one you have a natural affinity for or you've heard good recommendations for. If you can't build a workflow for it in 15 minutes, move on to the next one. If you succeed in 15 minutes, stick with that one. That's my general recommendation. Yeah, and as a somewhat independent person, you know, I don't I don't work for Relay, but um that's exactly what we've noticed when we're teaching people. So, um we use Zapia, we use Relay, we use N all internally at Hustlebadger. Um like everyone starting out, I push towards Relay because it's just so easy to get going. Um, and I only really push people towards N if they want to kind of create like their own agent, you know, or some something that's going to be like deployed into production or equivalent that's going to be like they're going to run evals on it that's going to have like that level. >> That's another great point. Like Relay is really built for internal business operations. Hiring an AI teammate. Relay isn't meant for building into your product. Um, so that that kind of breaks the mental model of like you wouldn't hire a teammate to like do a welcome email for every user in your product probably. Um, and so in those cases you can use relay, but probably you're going to have a better time with NADN. And and so someone in the chat wrote that order. I don't think that's a general order. I would not put NAND at the bottom generally. I think for less technical users, NAND can be hard to access, but NAND is very powerful. So I don't think there's a way to rank them. I don't think there's a way to rank these six tools in like pure rank order. I think it's more of like a a triangular space of technical ability, user friendliness, and integration depth where every I can maybe make a little diagram, Ed, and send it out to people where like every product and it depends on which axes that you you you care about most. Yeah. Yeah, that that would be superb. Um I think that'd be really really helpful. There's a couple of people asking if you can create um agents and then hand them over. So almost like an agency model where you're creating agents for for for clients. Is is that something that you've seen? Is that possible? >> Yeah, I would say about 10% of our customers work with a partner or a consultant who builds agents for them. And the way that works is if um a partner is creating an executive assist agent for me, I will give them temporary access to build agents using my credentials. So I can share my email connection with the partner just for the duration of the time that they're building the agent and then the agent still lives in in my workspace. So the way this works if you're a if you're a company working with a consultant, you add the consultant into your workspace. You give them access to the tools they need. They build the workflows in their work in your workspace and then you can either keep them in your workspace on retainer or you can part ways with them. No problem. If you're a an AI agency or automation consultant, you would tell your client to first set up their own relay workspace and then they would invite you to it. You'd build out the workflows and then what we typically see is that our partners, they have like a deep initial engagement where they build out a bunch of the workflows and then they have like a lightweight retainer for some multimonths after that to fix issues and help with training. There's a there's a few people asking when you're going to release these new features you've been demoing the kind of um you know the the uh the role descriptions the newer UI where you've got these kind of like different teammates you're you're launching. >> I'm not sure myself. Hopefully by the hopefully hopefully by the end of the year. Um uh but soon it's getting close. Like as you can see I think it's it's looking pretty nice. There's some little there's some little issues like the text box doesn't have as much. What you can do now, Oleg, is what I've been doing for the last year, is just make a folder. Make a folder, stick your workflows in the folder, and it's functionally sort of similar, but it doesn't look as pretty. But yeah, we're, as you can imagine, we're working hard to get that out as as fast as we can. And maybe I can ask my own question. Uh, Jacob, you've talked a little bit about how you kind of um, you know, check the answers and I know you can go through and check the output of each of the individual steps. Do you have any plans to add in um, sort of any kind of evals or is that something that you've seen people kind of set up in a hacky way um, so that they can test more complicated prompts and and uh, systems? >> Yeah, great point. So, first let me show you the different ways you can add a human in the loop into your workflow. If you want to feel confident that before the daily briefing gets sent out, it's good. One way you can do this is in the context of an AI step, you can add a human in the loop. And so, when the AI produces the daily briefing, it's going to ask the human to make one of three choices. A, does it look good? Go ahead and send it. B, do you want to edit it manually and improve it? or three, do you want to give me a refinement prompt to go back and and and try again? So that's a human in the loop step in the context of like directly collaborating with the AI to create the daily briefing. You can also create a standalone human in the loop step where do you see why I made a standalone step in the workflow where a human has to approve before the thing gets sent. Now, you would not do this for an internal daily briefing use case, but we see this very commonly for like a sales meeting follow-up where you may want the sales manager. You may want, for example, the sales representative to do the kind of deep collaboration with the AI to write the draft and then you want the sales manager to approve the draft before it goes out. In terms of eval, it's actually something we're working on right now. Right now, what you do is you basically just hit test prompt and then you select a previous event or set of events you want to test with and then you can just sort of like do a lightweight manual evaluation where you change the prompt or change the model. What we're working on is a slightly not a super complex, we're not going to rebuild all of lane chain, but like a slightly more robust system where you can say here are 10 previous emails. Here's what you should have said for each of them. Make sure you always get those 10 those 10 right. And the nice thing about an eval in this context is it's not just a one-off evaluation of how well the agent performs. The agent is going to use that context as a knowledge base in the future to make sure that it's that it's analyzing forthcoming emails using the information of decisions it made in the past. >> Yeah. Super. >> Okay. Any last questions? I think we've got five minutes left, so we can probably do one question then a quick a quick wrap-up. Oh, I see a question I think I missed from from Brent. A lot of organizations and industries try to apply re lean principles to the work they do. Will the use of agents reduce or eliminate the need to be efficient in workflows? Let me make two points in response to that that question. first is I think organizations of the future will look at staffing fundamentally differently than organizations of of of two years ago. And anyone saying anything different I think is either being deliberately misleading or is not fully understanding the the power of the trend here. In the olden days, whenever we had more work than our current team could do, we had two options. Do we hire someone new or do we rebalance priorities within within the existing team? And pretty much always we had to rebalance existing priorities because most of us did not have the luxury of infinite budget to just hire more headcount. So it was always a rep prioritization exercise. Now we have a third option. We don't need to hire new people. We don't need to prioritize internally. We can just do more because we can create AI agents to to give us leverage. And so I think that is going to be a fundamental tool in the toolbox that will enable companies to do much more per person. That doesn't necessarily mean companies will have smaller headcount. They might have the same headcount and then just achieve more per person or they might have a smaller headcount and keep achieving the same amount. Most of the customers that we talk to want to still grow their team and just achieve way more. So, I'm not saying there's some like doom and gloom job reduction argument. May be the case in some large customers, but in most companies, people will try to do more with either the same team or slightly more or slightly more people, but do way more. The other thing to keep in mind is when you're thinking about designing these workflows, how much do you need to worry about efficiency? Here's a very common email that I get from customers. My competitive research agent used 300 AI credits. That's kind of a lot of AI credits. How do I make my competitive research agent more efficient? And my response is usually, well, here's how to make it more efficient. You can use a cheaper model or pass in less data. But 300 AI credits is like 30 cents. and this wrote a 15page very high quality report for you. If you had asked an agency to write that high quality report for you, it would have been thousands of thousands of dollars. And so in general, my perspective is that if you're asking these AI agents to do anything valuable for you, they're going to come AC they're going to be so ridiculously cheap relative to the alternative that you don't need to worry about saving 5% of AI credits here or 5% of AI credits there. Your time your time is worth more than that. If you find yourself thinking, "Ah, this is not worth the 100 AI credits," then it's probably not worth building an AI agent for at all because you don't care enough about the thing. That's like my general advice. If it's something important that you care about in your business, don't worry about nickel and dimming on AI credits. Just get it working really well. And then, yeah, if it's running thousands of times a day and costing you dozens of dollars per day, then it might be worth um making it more efficient. But like, I wouldn't worry about something costing a dollar a month versus $2 a month if it's valuable to you. my that's personally. Okay. Um so if you found this useful a useful taste, I'm basically this is what you just saw is like the introductory 20 minutes of a course that I'm teaching starting next week for building those six AI agents. In the course, what we'll do is we'll actually go through each of those six agents one by one. We'll build out every single workflow. I'll show you all the techniques, triggers, actions, AI steps, prompts. Um, and I'll I'll personally grade your homework. So, I'll tell you anything I I recommend about how you can make your agents better. If you're interested in that, I think I pasted the link way back up at the beginning of the chat. Um, maybe we can send it out in the follow-up. Uh, Ed, and other than that, my name is Jacob. My email is Jacob related app. You can find me on LinkedIn. and I'm here to help anytime if you have any questions or feedback on how I can make this content more useful. And then yeah, sign up for all of Ed's stuff also. >> Thanks so much, Jacob. Um, that was absolutely uh excellent. A real tour to force there of taking us through through agents and and showing us some stuff live. Um, you know, I've been using Relay and and a bunch of other agent stuff for for, you know, months and I, you know, even stuff I was learning there. I've posted a link to uh to you on LinkedIn, as I say. um really recommend everyone to follow you because I know you're posting like ton of great stuff on on LinkedIn. I've posted the link to your Maven course. Um I've also again quick shout out for the Hustleb courses. I know in independent um evolution, we were kind of going the same direction. So we've got our own course on building out a team of agents that's launching in January. Um I think Jacobs is going to be awesome. Don't get me wrong. Ours is also going to be awesome. Um, and we have a second >> in general. In general, I'm gonna stick to more general techniques that will be useful for a very broad audience. And my guess is that Ed, you're going to go way deeper in the specific things that the Hustle Badger audience will care about. So, I don't think they're competitive courses at all. >> Yeah. I mean, I I I think I I genuinely think like either of those courses is going to be great because um, you know, I've spoken to this is not our first interaction. I know kind of like the quality of stuff that that that Jacob does. Um, we also have a second course if you do want to create those more complex agents like the kind of the N ones. You want to learn how to run evals, you want to show that you can build AI products and have a live product that you can stick in your portfolio, we have another course um called deploy an AI agent which we are also launching in January. So if you're looking for that kind of like step up, we we we can cover that as well. Um, I think that's it. We we will post the recording. We're going to email you all like a bunch of kind of reminders and links. So if you missed something then um we'll you know you'll have all the links and and and stuff there. But uh thanks once again Jacob being fantastic and hopefully we get a chance to do something again like this soon. >> Yeah. Thanks so much for hosting Ed. Thanks everyone for joining. See you all soon.
