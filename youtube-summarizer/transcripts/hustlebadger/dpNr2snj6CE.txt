Hello, I'm Susanna. I am one of the co-founders of Hustlebadger. I have been doing this with Ed, who many of you may know uh for the last three years. Um, but as I've been explaining to everyone, I'm the person who does all of the uh non-publicf facing stuff like, you know, making sure that we are compliant and we pay our bills and other glamorous things. Um, we're really excited to have Busher with us today to talk about strategic prioritization, what rice can't fix. Um, which I'm sure is a topic that many people have wrestled with right over the years. Um, just a bit of housekeeping. So, um, we'll be, uh, letting Busher talk. pop any questions you have in the chat or just interrupt if it's, you know, something really critical and you don't understand it and we need to clarify it before we can move on. And then we'll have a session bit of time at the end for Q&A. Um, and I will keep an eye on the chat, see what I can help with, um, and jump in if I think, you know, something's really critical and we need to cover it. Uh Bushra, I'm gonna hand it over to you and let you introduce yourself and then start kicking off. >> Yes, sure. Hi everybody. Um I'm Bushra. I mentioned already I'm from Berlin and I live in Zurich, Switzerland. Um I'm a product management coach and trainer and adviser and I usually work with companies um that have found product market fit and now trying to grow. and then they're wondering how they were able to basically brute force their PMF and then like what should we do now to grow better and that's where I come in and u make sure that they have um that they put some good product practices in place um well the majority of of my work is in connecting strategy with execution like this the mess the the the messy middle right and I work with sandwich rolls like the ones that are in the middle that that have a boss who's like staring at them, maybe yelling at them, I don't know. And then they have a team that they have to um um to manage and make sure that they that they perform. And um so I get in and help them um connect the dots and make the make the strategy work basically. >> Brilliant. Should we kick off? Yes, let's start. So then let me share my screen. Then the whole presentation today is on Miro. So let's hope that they're not going to have a major release right now. >> You love a mirror board. >> Good. Can you see my screen? Can you see me cursing basically? >> Yes. >> And it's Thank you. Great. And it's quite a thing when you start a presentation with cursing, right? It's a damn prioritization. But I'm pretty sure many of you feel this way when you think about the backlog with 14,000 items and you look at it and you're like, "Oh my gosh, I don't want to touch it." And I'm not kidding. I once worked for a startup where we had 14,000 backlog items 1 1400 0 it was a nightmare or next time when you have to present your road map actually what what you need to put on the road map right so what is the right thing that you need to put on the road map and you're like oh my god there are so many pieces of the puzzle I don't know if I do this then this person will be angry and this person would be mad at me and so on so forth right so um this is happening on the PM side of the world. Now on the product leader side of the world, well as a product leader, you might not directly be saying, you know, oh these damn prioritization problems, but whenever your team delivers something that you believed you agreed not that should not be built, but then suddenly it's on production, you're like, "Oh my god." or whenever you go into your one-on-one with your product manager and you talk about the road about the road map and ask them like okay what are you going to work on next and then there's this whole uncomfortable silence in the room you're like so you might not directly think that this is a prioritization problem but it is a prioritization problem so whatever we do every day where we're dealing with prioritization problems um and we might not be aware that it is one. So yeah, some of you might naturally be cursing actually. So here's the thing. Um, prioritization is difficult and it's not going to become easier after this talk. I promise. Sorry. But when prioritization is painful, there's a difference because then you have a completely different problem. There's a difference between difficult because that's the nature of the thing and painful. So today in the presentation strategic prioritization what rice can fix. We will talk about what prioritization really means. And here's the spoiler. Prioritization is a cascade of decisions from strategy to backlog with lots of back and forth with lots of ups and downs. But at the end of the day, it starts with strategy. And to show you how I'm how serious I am with this cascade thing, I mentioned this presentation is built on mural for a reason because it has the shape of a cascade. That's the presentation. And we will go through this cascade during the presentation. As you can see, we will start with strategy. That's the agenda basically. Then we will continue with strategy. Then we will continue one more time with strategy and then we will cover the question. Okay. How does discovery and research fit in and then we get on the road map level. So initiatives, ideas, themes, whatever. Okay. So we get on this level and only then we go way down to the backlog. And as you can see it is the very last line of this whole prioritization cascade right and road map is somewhere in the middle there right but there is stuff that needs to be h that needs to happen before there are decisions that need to happen before and then we will close it with a short conclusion the second thing that you can see here is that I have a little bit of theoretical input and then we go into the whole decision-m cascade Ready? Yes. Wonderful. I'm very sorry to put a cliffhanger in here. I mentioned about me and who I am. I just wanted to plug this in to mention why this topic is so important to me. I've worked with many companies in the past 5 years. Um before that I was 10 years and hands on in product management and the topic that I'm talking about is something that I keep seeing everywhere that there is this lack of awareness how important strategic decisions or decision making on the strategic level is important for good prioritization on the team's level. And that's why it's so important for me to basically talk about um this topic and share what I've what I've observed over the years. All right, let's start with the little piece of of theory. And here's a promise. This is the first or one of the few let's say prioritization talks without teaching you any prioritization technique. However, I will give you I will talk a little bit about first principles. Okay? And that's the theory part. And you will be you will be um you you will see um how we can even turn an easy topic like prioritization into a PhD topic. Basically, let's start with the first part. Let's talk about some first principles. When I say what is prioritization, what I typically hear are things like, oh, we make a preference. Oh, we decide to do something instead of something or somebody says something like, oh, I will show you a list of topics, typically features, uh, a list of features. And then uh prioritization is basically picking which feature I should I should build next. Right? Some people maybe throw in tradeoffs. We need to make tradeoffs and then I'm like ooh okay we're good. We getting in the right direction somewhere right? But meta thinking first principles thinking prioritization is more than that. All of these pieces that I just mentioned are basically the out outcome in that sense even of specific activities. And here are the main three activities that we actually do when we prioritize. It's categorization, filtering, and sorting. Very short. What is what? So categorization basically means we have a bunch of items. We put them into buckets and we give them a headline. That's the label. And then this bucket stands for whatever that label says. And because we are cool and and fancy and we we use jargon, uh we call this cluster. So that's categorization. And whenever we get a new item, we look at it and decide which cluster that goes into. And that's it. That's easy categorization. Then filtering. Filtering is basically um has the aim to reduce a bunch of items into a smaller number of items. We decide for at least one criterion um ideally uh multiple criteria and then we filter all items that we get through these criteria and and all like any item that doesn't fit to our criteria just gets ruled out. it's it's out. We don't look at it anymore. We filter it. Right? And this way we get we reduce the number of items that we that we handle. And the last one third one is sorting. That's this typical thing of of creating one ordered line of items sorted by something. And this something typically is an expression of return on investment. So typically like default is money in money out right? So how much money do do I get for the money that I put in? But return and investment actually need to be defined um specifically for the thing at hand. Like what are we doing here? For example, if we're running experiments, then the return for any uh potential experiment could be um the learning strength that we receive for the investment of time and money that we put in to run this experiment. Yeah. How long do we have to wait to get this piece of learning and how strong is this piece of learning for the time that we have waited for that return on investment? Okay, so very meta thinking meta level categorize filter sort. You see they are in red. So that means pay attention to where you see these um words in red because that's where I will refer back to these activities. That's the first piece of my PhD. So the second piece of the PhD for um uh about about prioritization is frameworks. all these frameworks. We have so many frameworks and we even get into heated discussions if rice is better than ice or is that better than pai or whatever abbreviate food abbreviation you can find and and and throw at it. Right? At the end of the day we can boil all of them down into four concepts. All of these fancy frameworks are based on four concepts. Again meta thinking right? The four concepts are scoring, matrices, 2 * 2 or 3 * 3, ruling out and calculation, scoring. So I mentioned um I mentioned rice for example. Um but scoring basically has the aim to again put some criteria score them and it has the aim to give us a number that stands as a representative for return on investment. What you will see many many times is um that the criteria has some sort of an impact element right. So how how strong um or what is really the impact of it or how strong is the signal that we receive like what is the impact part like what's the value part or representation of the value and some sort of an investment part right so what is the effort that we need to put in or how easy is it to build how much do we have to wait for that right so there is always a cost part of it so we score for getting an idea of the return on investment then we have matrices Matrices are a relative way of prioritization that comes handy when we don't have absolute data, right? And we are trying to compare apples with pies or so and then we notice it doesn't matter or it's actually both apples or actually they're um both apples are have the same size or one is smaller, one is bigger, right? So it's a relative way of saying which one do we think should we um pursue, right? So which item should we continue with? Um again here you select two to three criteria and then you place the item based on your assessment of these criteria. The result of um matrices are typically categorized items. You know like the upper right corner means something upper left corner means something. Lower right and lower left corners mean something. And that's the category that we put the items in. I promise it's going to be in PhD. Right? Then we have ruling out. It's basically the same like filtering, right? So you have your criteria and you say yes, it's in or no, it's not. So again, reduce every opportunity or solution um or like dismiss every opportunity or solution that doesn't uh match your criteria. And then calculation. The most typical and famous way of calculating something is business cases. Okay? Writing business cases, maybe a back of the envelope calculations. So we use this a lot in in trying like when we try to figure the business value of what we're of um of the item of what we're looking at, right? um or like the growth impact like product metrics like how how do we how much growth we will achieve when we run this or when we release this feature right good but overall all frameworks can be boiled down to these four concepts scoring matrices ruling out and calculation to summarize okay three activities categorization filtering sorting and four framework concepts scoring matrix is ruling out calculation. I will now go below the line to get into the decision making um cascade. You will see in red categorization, filtering and sorting here. And there when I say hey now we could for example do this activity you will see scoring matrices ruling out calculations whenever I try to give you an example. Okay. So it only because I pick one of these framework types doesn't mean that we cannot use the other framework types. It's just like to give you an example. That's what's going to happen now. Ready? This time no cliffhanger. I promise. Good. Let's start. Let's start with Mr. Marty Kagan smiling at us. So, every great presentation needs a quote by an expert. I have bought you my most favorite quote because it's a quote in a quote that makes it two experts and two quotes which makes this presentation twice as good as any other presentation. Just keep that in mind. So this is um a quote from one of his blog articles where he's talking about strategy and he says every good product strategy begins with this focus. Good strategy works by focusing energy and resources on one or a very few pivotal objectives whose accomplishment will lead to a cascade of favorable outcomes. Richard Remote. If the leaders are not willing or able to make these choices then the product strategy is doomed from the start. So basically what we can see here is already that hey we need to make choices. We need to make choices from the very start or the strategy meaning the execution of the strategy is not going to work. And the same is true for prioritization because prioritization is part of the execution of the strategy. If we don't make choices, that means we have not prioritized what we really need and what we really want to achieve and what we want to focus on. Keeping this in mind, let's start with, as I promised, the big strategy part number one, long-term strategy. What is our focus in general? So the leaders in the room, this is your duty to really make your choices, place your bets. It's a very difficult um conversation. It's a very difficult decision to make or decisions to made um as we're looking into a very very long-term time, right? So we are talking about at least 3 years if not five or maybe even 10 years. And we have to think about in which direction we even want to go. Right? This is nothing like very concrete this step or that goal next year and so on. It's more about high level which direction we want to go. Amazon has um had to had to decide whether they're going to launch in Switzerland or not. The strategic decision is yes we want to enter the Swiss market. Now we have to figure out how. But that's a strategic decision on that level, right? So yes, we want to enter um the Swiss market. And then they had to figure out how do we do that? Are we going to build up um warehouses in Switzerland or is it more like we have to make a partnership with somebody to get into the market? Switzerland for everything here. There is there is a either a monopoly or a duopoly. So and if you're if you're in retail, you have to cooperate with one of the big two retailers. Should we do that? What is the way in? What is the good way in? What is a way in uh with creating lots of enemies? What is a way in with um creating partnerships instead? Right? Like these questions, they are heavy and it's a very heavy work. But you need to make some preferences here. You have to place your bets. So what did Amazon do? They entered the Swiss market but without building warehouses here. Instead, they decided to use the warehouses in the countries around and send the products from those countries into Switzerland. That's a strategic choice, right? To make it this way, that's a strategic choice. And instead partner with um Swiss customs, partner with the Swiss post um and and distribute the products this way. There's not even an Amazon.ch. So anyone who's in Switzerland needs to buy from Amazon in Germany or or France or somewhere else. But these bets need to be made based on your choices how you want to um approach your vision. you as leaders like high level leaders right management uh level based on that you define your steps like hey first uh try to get a partnership with post or whatever second if that doesn't work think about building a warehouse okay should we really build no let's see how we can like which warehouse can we partner with instead of building one so that we can ship products over there in and and send it um um within the country from there right so These big steps need to be planned and that is all based on those decisions that you made. Very high level, very long-term strategy here. We already need to make our choices. Now you will see me moving downwards for the first time. So whenever I slide downwards, we go one level deeper in the cascade. Whenever I slide sidewards, as you as you just saw, we stay on the same level. Okay? And now we're moving one level down from long-term strategy to midterm strategy, but we still stay with strategy. So, what is your focus this year? It doesn't have to be this year, right? So, it it depends on your on your industry. Like if you're in a um in healthcare for example like just looking at one year might not be enough. So your midterm might be three years because your long term is 10 years for example. Right? So this this depends on on on the horizon that you typically look at. But what is your midterm focus? Here's an example. So what we want to do is filtering. We have we have already on the layer above made some choices and now it's on us to start filtering. We can have lots of ideas but it doesn't work if they don't connect to our goals above. Let's say as an example in our yearly let's say our midterm is is is yearly and in our in our yearly planning we set three business objectives. Okay. One is grow market share, two is fulfill more demand, and three is grow revenue per customer. So, well, first of all, you will look at that and say like, uh, but they're a bit contradicting and I will say yes, I chose that on purpose because that's reality, right? That's what what what we get. That's like we want to have it all. But that that's how it works. Okay, but let's say it's this one way how you could filter now as an example is you could look at your themes. You could look at your business objectives and say which theme or outcomes or opportunities or initiatives like topics like however you work in your company. You could say does this theme contribute to business objective number one and two or three in in which way? I use scoring here, right? So yeah, as this that's a sign of of scoring. You could you use anything else. You could write a business case and and and show how much it contributes to to business objective one or two or three or or whatever like like some sort of of of decision- making. And this way you filter and you decide. You could say, well, business objective one and two have a have a higher priority. So theme A, we continue with theme A because it contributes to one and two. If it doesn't contribute to three, we don't care. You could say that, right? Or you could be even more strict and say, "No, no, no, no. We only pick the theme that contributes to all business objectives." And as soon as a a theme doesn't contribute to um only one or two of those three, it's out. That's maybe the only um prioritization technique that will be new for you in in this in in this talk. It's called binstack. I I really like it. This is a very cruel prioritization technique. It's really ruthless. Um look into it, Google it. Uh it's really nice. Uh but that is a way that you like another way a very very strict way to to uh filter basically. Okay. In some way you then have picked some themes or objectives or out not objectives but outcomes maybe right or opportunities or something. And now let's move one level deeper and we continue with strategy as I promised you, right? But now we look at right now the execution part. What is happening shortterm? What is our focus shortterm? Let's say you're working with OKRs in a quarterly on a quarterly basis. Okay, let's let let's assume that whatever whatever it is that that that is your cadence and let's say your objectives are create a happy customer base, grow mobile advertising, you reduce time to experience the core value from new users and now you do the same, right? So you filter again and on these levels we filter the hell out of our list because we don't want to deal with millions of ideas. Whatever doesn't fit into our strategic decision so far is out. we will still end up with lots of um lots of lots of many other themes. But this reduces already uh what we have to handle, right? And if we're good and if we're very strict, then we might even end up with only a handful of topics. But until now, we have so far just filtered. Okay. Now for those who are bored of filtering like me, let's look what could be otherwise be doing. Okay. So we now have our filtered list of opportunities or solutions. Depends on how how your company works. Some companies work with opportunities, some others with solutions. We now have that. What are we do going to do with that? Well, is it all? Those of you who are actually running discovering research might now ask themselves like, well, that sounds like pretty waterfally. Like, somebody's telling me what to do. So, what should I do now? How can I contribute even if all those decisions were already made and and like why should we even do any product discovery or or research activities? Aren't we agile anymore? And some of you might be saying like, "Oh, I wished I had this question. What what we should do about opportunities or solutions that come from discovering research?" Because we're not doing any discovering research at all. You guys have another problem. Okay, for those who don't have this problem, you have a different problem. Um, for all for all the others who are wondering now, what we should do is this. We follow the same logic. We filter. For example, if you're using an opportunity solution tree on the top here, we have a product outcome. What do you think where this product outcome should come from? That should directly connect to the strategic choices that we made above. Why should we work on on um something that helps us improve customer satisfaction when our main focus is actually for a quarter for example to grow the customer base? There might be there might be an answer to that, right? So, but it there needs to be a connection or you do the more um advanced version. you start with an impact map and in an impact map you already derive the the the outcome that you work on from the business goal. Right? You start with a business goal and then you get to the outcome and you only look at opportunities basically that follow the outcome that has a direct connection to the business goal that you're working towards. And there you have your filtering embedded basically. Or what you could also do is you could categorize first, right? This should be red. I just noticed. So you could categorize first or sort first, right? And then filter. For example, cano analysis. Anyone? Anyone's using that. Here's an example how you could do that with analysis. Let's say, again, it's everything about connecting with a strategy, right? A calendar product. Let's say you work on a calendar product and your business goal is create an AI strategy for our company. Anyone um slap AI everywhere it's just going to fix everything. Okay, sarcasm over. Um and let's say your focus persona is a busy product manager and you come out with lots of research and you find different um potential opportunities that go into different buckets cluster. Sorry we say cluster because we are cool. So into different clusters cluster dissatisfy cluster satisfying cluster lighter. And from all the features you find that AI optimizes your calendar based on your goal. E maximize time for deep work. And AI suggests who you should invite to the meeting sound like a really good combination for the next couple of um release cycles. Why? because, you know, we haven't worked on the lighters yet. So, let's take something from the delighter bucket. Um, and we should always be working on satisfiers anyways. And and then here's a cool feature. Let's work on that because, you know, x% of our our sprint should be filled with with satisfiers or whatever you rule you have, right? But this way with categorizing first, we can make a decision on what to build on next. That basically um connects to the strategy above. Okay, cool. What do we do now? What do we do with these? Well, we put it into this filtered list of opportunities and solutions that pay into strategy because we have revised it now because now we have data and then we can say this is in this is out because our data says qualitative or quantitative data says that pays into strategy and has lots of impact and we should work on that. Okay, but what about the frameworks? I want frameworks because why the hell um do we have this whole discussion about the ice rice pie frameworks or whatever frameworks out there if they if Bishra now says they are meaningless. Well, here's the thing. I don't say it's meaningless. I just say use whatever you prefer. I don't care. That's what I say. What like the discussion is not about the framework. Which framework is best? The discussion should be about which decisions should we have made on uh up to now right and zooming out as you can see now that we're on the which framework I should we use discussions we have already made lots of strategic decisions here and even done some discovering research right and now okay let's discuss frameworks which one should we use um that's preference and here is an overview of different prioritization frameworks that um help you with different activities when you're when you're prioritizing, right? Um it like it also they also help with other activities, but um you know they they have their strength in in one or two of those activities. Pick whatever you prefer. I don't care. The main point of all these frameworks are that they help you assess impact. And another way for impact is value. Okay, so we could actually say here impact equals value. That's what we're looking for. We are trying to create value. And then um let's say let's do a m matrix in in many many matric matrices. We have some sort of an impact assessment, right? So it's either impact or it's importance or how much business value versus uh customer value do we get whatever whatever and um we have high impact stuff we have low impact stuff and I tell you I don't care about low impact stuff like why should we spend any time on things little things that don't create any impact other than it's political reasons right or like some cleanups that need to be done and so okay fair but other than that a new feature, great. It's maybe going to help us um you know, convert 10 out of thousand customers versus a new feature that's going to help us convert 100 out of thousand customers. You know what I'm saying? Cool. So, I don't care about low impact stuff, right? So, and then the horizontal line, pick whatever you want. Is it effort? Is it um um evidence? is that um time we are waiting for the learning impact whatever so whatever it is I don't care so now what I do care is now that we know we have picked high impact stuff I will ask you do we really know do we really know that this thing that we think that's going to have high impact really going to have high impact check your confidence because prioritization is more about impact and confidence through evidence than about any score Okay, the scores. Who needs scores? Nobody needs needs scores. Um, having said that, I have an example with a scoring system. But without the scores, as you can see, um, it's really more about the conversation and the thinking behind that uh, these um, scoring systems or any prioritization frameworks um, help us do, right? than the score that comes out of any calculation. So for example with ICE scoring how could this look like? Well, we think the impact of this thing, however you define impact, you have to define impact. Nobody's going to define impact, right? So, that's what you have to define in your team. What does it mean impact? Okay. So, let's say we think this item, this idea is going to have an impact of eight. Whatever eight stands for, you have to define that too. Um, but we are really not certain about it. It sounds pretty easy to build. I would say, well, I don't care if it's easy to build or not. If it's going to if you think it might have high positive impact, well, it might also have high negative impact, right? Check it. You you you have no clue. You're you're guessing. Check it if it's really going to have high impact or not. On the other hand, you might also say you could add as another scoring criterion risk into that, right? So, and if you say, "Hey, risk is super low. We could just easily revert it." Then I would say, "Well, go build. Who cares if you're confident or not? go build and see if it's going to work or not. Right? So in that conversation, the confidence suddenly doesn't even matter anymore because it's not risky. Then go build it. Right? So these systems, these frameworks are good for a discussion. But what they are not is where this idea came from. Because let me zoom out again. This idea came from making strategic decisions here that basically reduced your creativity field. Well, that sounds negative. More like that gave you u some um creative con uh uh constraints so that you don't think about the world, right? But more like about a continent maybe or a country. Okay. So, how do you assess confidence? There are two ways. Um, one is you use an existing framework. I love it confidence meter. Um, I'm still using it like for for anything. I I have site uh businesses myself and um every now and then I I do some discovery on some ideas that I have and I myself use the confidence meter as well. Uh for B2B you have to adapt it slightly. So this is um very very strong in well let's not let's not say B2B but very strong in data heavy environments for um environments where you have little data you might have to um um adjust it not just might you you should adjust it but in general it's it's a good tool or um like we did in um one of the companies uh that I work for actually the company where we had 14,000 backlog items one of the things that we did to to handle this beast was then introduce a a confidence system. This is an example what you could do, right? So you can define your own confidence levels and and what it means, right? With like how much how confident are we if some if if a um uh colleague just shared their most favorite supporting insights with us, right? So how how confident are we then? So you could uh build that um for your for yourself. Now the results of that okay we have an impact assessment somehow we want to we want to follow the high impact work then we want to be be um we cannot be 100% sure but we want to have some confidence that it's really going to have um impact and the results of this assessment and you can really do it with any framework doesn't have to be scoring is categories now we're back into categorization right so because now we can define okay this is a bucket it cluster. This is a cluster. I want to be cool. So, this is a cluster where we could say these ideas need to be um experimented with because we don't have enough insights if that's really a good idea or not. These ones we're going to reject totally because they're not worth it. Um here are some opportunities that we should explore. Um for these ones, we need more data. Whatever the like whatever you categorize into like whatever your your categories are but in the end you can define what you can do you can do you don't have to what you could do with the items now that fall into this bucket that bucket or that bucket and then now that we have that now that we have a list of categorized backlog items that pay into strategy If we were again we if we were very strict with with um with filtering and ruling out okay then we would have a list of categorized backlog items that would pay into strategy. And now yes we are on the backlog level. We made it. We are on the very very last line of the whole cascade. We are here right? We made it. We are here. And now that's the part where I say sort it just put it into an order and then you know decide which will be executed and this sounds so easy and I I I um also in the like when I work with teams and and coach them and all of that the typical question is yeah this is so easy when you say it but you know there are so many things that we have to uh that we have to consider like I cannot just build what we think is right And you're right, I say because that's where I say now, well, backlog prioritization is somewhat of an art. And here now, like, you know, throw everything out of the window. You don't need frameworks. You don't need a coach telling you how to do it or um whatever. You look into your very own situation and you consider the input that you have. Okay? You you you there might be politics. Okay? There might be politics and you might have to be satisfying specific stakeholders at this one. Yeah, it might be it might be a situation where you just have to put something in for them. Um you um might need to um work on tech that you might need to look into the balance of how much delivery versus discovery is planned in. Yeah. So for discovery work, we sometimes have to build something. So maybe there's something that we have to build AB tests for example right maybe there's a deadline GDPR does anyone remember GDPR that was nightmare right so maybe there's a deadline that you have to meet and then you have to throw everything out of the window maybe you're at you're working at at Google you've you've you've got code red yeah so you don't know I don't know so you just put everything in and then you ask yourself what does your intuition say and that's okay because here we're in the art part of things Okay. And then you put something together and just blend it. Just blend it. Just do it, you know, and then it's going to be fine. Like some iterate on it. Some you can never make everybody happy in the room, right? So there will be people who will be pissed off like why isn't my wish on the list? Why are you still not working on that? You you can't you you cannot control it. Okay? People will be pissed off. It's fine. Cool. We made it. We made it all the way down. All started from strategy, continued with strategy, continued with strategy, blended some discovery and research, looked into road maps and the backlog level. And the interesting part is so whenever we talk about prioritization people think that we only need to think of backlog and road map but prioritization I hide it so well starts here. It starts from the top. To give you a little bit of a summary of what I'm trying to say here, um, is that prioritization is difficult. It's going to stay difficult, but can be effective. An effective prioritization starts with strategic choices from very long-term to near-term. Always filters against strategic goals, zooms in and out, goes back and forth like we did this linear thing, right? So from top to bottom. But hey, please go up again whenever you need. Go up again. Go back and forth. Go up and down. Right? And does not only rely on sorting. You do many other things. Prioritization is not sorting. Please painful prioritization um happens when strategic focus isn't set. Goals are not clear. Um decisions change too often. in the same company that I mentioned every month management would come back and have different priorities and we would be like we don't even need to start working on something right so this is not a strategic decision um or when strategic decisions are made but not communicated well can also happen so here's my ask prioritization is a joint effort and you as leaders and IC's are a team too. So, work well together on that. Leaders here in this call, make your choices and narrow down the options to enable prioritization. You're the prioritization enablers. And you can only do that when you make your strategic choices. And as individual contributors in the rooms in the room, show options like show them. They need your help, right? Make them suggestion. they they only know their own world, but they're not down on the execution level. They don't see everything. So, give them enough input, can give them the input that they need and even make suggestions so that they can then make their choices. It doesn't mean that they will follow what you say, but they will only be able to take it into account when you speak it out. So therefore get out of prioritization pain through strategic prioritization as a joint effort and then the rest is going to be fine. Thank you very very very much. Um I looked at the number of people who stayed in the room and it's quite constant. So I hope this was somewhat um engaging but also in informative at the same time give you some inspiration and other than that I can only say hey let's connect on LinkedIn and please visit hustle better um I'm taking their courses myself they're really good and and they did not pay me to say this I'm just saying it's really good >> we actually did not pay Bushra to say that um thanks Thank you so much. That was a great great talk. Um, we had a couple of Sorry, my doorbell's just gone at this crucial moment, which is awesome. I'm going to ignore it. Um, we had a couple of questions in the chat. So, Benny asked, um, how detailed is the does the item have to be to go over the filter stage? So, I think this is in your initial theory section in your three categories. Yeah. >> Yeah. Um it doesn't h it usually cannot be super detailed. It it's usually um in the very initial stage like the long-term and midterm strategy. Um we know little about the future, right? Not to say we know nothing. Um latest since uh November 2022 when chacheti was in the public we understood we don't know anything about this world. Um so therefore like you cannot make it super detailed but what you should know is how does does the topics that we're looking at like on the management level how do the topics that we're looking at target group channels location right so the market that we are looking into the industry that we want to position in the positioning that we're thinking about um how do they play well together if like do they play well together right Um and it's like think about like a web when we pull on this what's going to happen with the others right that's one way of looking at it and then the other way of looking at it is like when you suggest initiatives for that then you should have a case that sounds sound right that it's going to help with one of these major decisions that they made. And yes, ideally there's a business case attached to it because we're on the on the on the management level. They need to plan finance, right? There should be business case um attached to it. I'm not a big believer in business cases. I have seen so many fake business cases, but they will expect it from you. So, make sure that your assumptions are are solid in the business case. Um they will want to have um some coherent actions from you. They will want to hear like how are you going to execute on this? Like why should we like why should we uh consider this? How are you going to execute on this? What is it um that we will like what's the gain um on the higher company level in the direction that we're going um that we will that we will have from this initiative? How how how will it help us go in the in the right direction? like you should have some details but you will not be able to to give them an answer on which features to build right because that's on that level too big and they don't want to they don't want to know usually. So again depends right when you work at a startup then the horizons are way way shorter and they do want to know and they do consider the feature level but like as I mentioned I usually come in after PMF and they're typically it's like tell me what it's about but not necessarily about the features kind of thing. >> Does that answer your question, Benny? Yes. Thumbs up. Um, got a question. Is this going to be recorded and made available on YouTube? I can answer this one. Yes, it will. And I'll send you all an email as well with a link to the recording. Um, we had another sort of comment from Zach. I don't know if Zach's on the call and wants to make it himself, but yeah, he was saying this all feels like it's another way of going saying let's go back to the brief, i.e. let's get back to the problem we're trying to solve from traditional marketing briefs. So, it's about continuously bringing people back to that focus. >> Where is the question? >> It's it's not a question. It's a comment from Zach. Um, okay. Got one from Manuel. Will the mirror link be shared as well? >> I don't open up the mirror link, but I'm happy to um download the um the backup the presentation as a backup and you can upload it in your own mirror space. >> Okay, cool. Um any other questions from Bushra? Anyone? Well, it looks like you explained things so well that everybody >> or I confused everybody or the rest is like nah, not applicable. >> I don't think so. Everyone's still on the call and lots of people saying nice things anymore. All right. Well, in that case, I'm just going to say thank you very much. That was absolutely fabulous. Loved the structure. It was so meta. It was great. >> The the cascade. >> Yes. >> Thank you everybody for for staying in and listening till the end. >> Bye now everyone. Thanks for it was great. >> Thanks for having me.
