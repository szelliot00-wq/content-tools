Hi everyone. So I am Ed. I'm one of the co-founders of Hustlebadger and delighted to have with us tonight Jason Knight. >> We want to get away from the feature factory. We want to start to understand and build things before people are asking for them, not after that they're asking for them. Companies are chasing a lot of short-term revenue from what you might call the wrong customers. The amount of teams that I go into where the the product and the sales teams just just ain't speaking. It's unbelievable. And it needs to happen here. Take them out for a coffee. go and chat to them, find out what's motivating them, find out what's on their mind. You can't just sit back, throw stuff over the wall, and just expect the sales team to say it. You've got to get involved. >> Hi everyone. So, I am Ed. I'm one of the co-founders of Hustlebadger. And um delighted to have with us tonight Jason Knight, who is a product leader, you specializing particularly in the B2B space. He's got an amazing podcast. He does loads of fractional work. He has a course on Maven. Lots of good stuff there. This is the first of a bunch of talks we're going to be doing with kind of experts. With that, Jason, over to you. >> Hello. Thanks. Thanks, Ed. And thanks for coming, everyone. Hopefully, everyone's had a great day and everyone's not had too many arguments or fights with the sales team. But we're going to talk a lot about the sales team and that kind of product sales relationship today. So, uh, before we do that though, I'm actually going to, you know, Ed said, "Let's go interactive." So, I'm going to go interactive and play a little little game of bingo. It's not actually quite how we play bingo because we'd have to do it like one by one, but I just going to go through a few things that kind of I've heard in my travels around the kind of the sales and product sphere. And I want you to kind of count up or tally up on your fingers how many of these things that you said and we'll get to the that you've heard in your companies. So, things that you can hear from the sales team. We're a customer-driven company, but of course, I don't mean all of the customers. They mean one customer at a time. This is just a quick win. Can we fast track this with a strategic client? This is a strategic deal. If we do this, it'll open up a whole new market for us. If we just have this one feature, we'll definitely close the deal. That's just a small change. It's a contractual commitment. We already said we're going to do it. It's a deal dependency. We need we need a date committed so that we can actually tell the client that this is coming. The product team doesn't understand the market at all. That's it's a sales team's job. You know, if product build it, sales will sell it. The customer says it's a mustave. I've already promised it to the customer. our competitors already do this, so we have to do this. We can't say no to this deal. These are all things or variations of things I've heard on my travel. But these aren't all things that you hear when you're out and about uh talking to sales teams from the product management side and kind of not really things that product management teams want to hear. And this kind of gets to the root of the problem as per the title of the presentation that uh you know sales are from Vina or products are from Mars and sales are from Venus. It's just like that classic old book. They're both living in what seems to be completely different worlds. They seem to use different languages. They have different motivations. They seem to just be operating on different planets. And I'm I'm going to go out on a limb and say that it's almost like one of the most dysfunctional relationships that I see when I when I walk into any company as Ed said, you know, I'm working in the B2B space, working with a lot of companies that have, you know, maybe they're selling into the enterprise and it kind of feels like when you walk into these organizations that there's just so little communication or kind of any kind of um alignment between those two teams and half the time they only seem to speak to each other when there's some kind of escalation. there's no relationship at all and this feels like something that needs to be fixed. Now, I don't know if anyone knows of Steve Johnson. Steve is a product leader, used to work for Pragmatic Marketing, now runs product growth leaders community. Has a wonderful quote about sales and product sales is responsible for this year's revenue. Product management is responsible for next year's revenue. You sit there and you think, well, that sounds absolutely perfect. That that's what I believe. You know, we should as product teams be building for the future and the sales team should be selling what we already have. But what you'll get from every single sales rep that you speak to is, "Well, we need the product management team to help us get this year's revenue. Look, it's not we're not even worrying about next year's revenue yet. We we need your help now." No B2B salesperson probably believes in that former quote. They're all looking for help to get the bills over the line one way or the other because that's how they're gold within the organization. So, having said that, you might sit there and and say, "Well, okay, I'm going to, you know, beat sales up for 30 minutes or whatever." But actually the first thing I'm going to say is that the sales team is actually doing its job. And by that I mean the sales team they've been hired and they've been incentivized and they've been told to go out and get revenue on a quarterly basis. They have targets. If they don't hit the targets they probably get fired or at the very least they don't earn as much money which means that you know they're in a situation where we can't exactly criticize them for going out and trying to do that because that's what they've been told to do. And I genuinely believe that if we uh incentivized and and targeted product managers exactly the same as we did with sales teams and gave them quarterly revenue goals, they would make all of the same decisions that the uh that the sales team, you know, that we criticize sales teams for making. Then there's a question we have to ask ourselves. Is the product management team doing its job? Now, we might sit there in our product management ivory towers and think that everyone needs to come to us and that we're, you know, we're the ones that are right and all of the things that we believe from all the books that we're talking about that they're the they're the ones that tell the whole truth and anyone else that doesn't follow our vision is, you know, not on board or or not doing the right job. But I think a lot of the time it's fair to say that, you know, the the dysfunction between product management and sales also comes from the product management side. Product management maybe aren't really, as I said before, working with the sales team. They're not speaking to the sales team. They're not trying to explain things to the sales team in a way that makes sense to them. And they're not listening to what the sales team is saying back to them. So, I'm not going to sit there and make excuses for every single sales team out there. But at the same time, we do need to make sure that the product management team are doing is doing its job as well. Another uncomfortable statement. No one in the business really cares about being productled and you sound dumb when you say it. Now, I'm not 100% sure I believe in my own statement there, but I think there is some truth to this. this idea that somehow to the previous point that all we need to do is persuade salespeople to be productled or to persuade the organization to be productled. We're not a salesled organization. We're a productled organization. It's like look there's obviously a lot to love around productled growth which is a different thing to what people mean when they say product. productled growth with user, you know, self-service acquisition and upselling yourself into the products and referrals and well the kind of the pirate metrics acquisition and and activation, referral uh or revenue, retention and referral. Like that's a wonderful model and it works for a lot of products, but it doesn't work for all products. And it's naive to think that every single business can just go productled growth, but that's not what people that say product means. What they seem to try to mean is product should be making all the decisions. And frankly, no one wants to be told that they're being led by anyone. Converting from salesled to productled isn't a goal. You've got to work together. A less uncomfortable statement. It's in everyone's interest to have a great product. Sales teams want to have a great product. If they have a great product, it's easier for them to sell. the more uh units of or whatever licenses of that product that they can sell, the better for them, the better, you know, the money they get, the better the better they do in their career. And of course, it's in our interest to have a great product. So again, it's not that anyone wants it, you know, the product to go bad or wants to wants us to make poor decisions. It's a simply a difference of opinion on the best way to get there. And I think it's in both or it's in all of our interest for both of us to come together on this stuff more rather than treating it as two separate camps. So just a quick thing on how teams work. You know, product and sales teams. Sales teams, we all probably know this, but just kind of a recap. You know, sales teams are speaking to individual customers one at a time. Uh they're speaking to those customers now. They're not worrying about next year yet. Next year is going to come next year. Look at they're worrying about revenue. They're being paid, sales teams being paid based on the performance. They're being paid on the revenue that they bring in directly. Uh and generally speaking, it's always the sales teams, you know, they're the ones with the bell or the gong that they can ring. you know, generally a large and influential organization. They're the ones that get celebrated when the big deal is coming. You never see the product team getting lorded for winning the big deal. It's the sales team because they've done the work to get that deal in. Product team, generally speaking, looking at broader market segments. You know, they don't not care about individual customers, but they definitely care about market segments more. They're looking hopefully for the for the future, and they're looking at market potential, sort of revenue in the long term, not instant immediate revenue. But it's fair to say that in many cases their compensation seems to be tied to in some cases barely anything. Like they kind of get paid whatever happens, which isn't always true, but certainly in many organizations there does seem to be a disconnect. They're not being bonused, as we said before, on winning the deals. They're not being bonused on revenue. They're being paid kind of whatever happens to some extent. Uh again, not in all companies, but certainly in some companies. And generally speaking, a much smaller and less influential team. many organizations that are you know salesdriven uh they you may be very much seen as facilitators rather than strategic enablers and generally speaking just not necessarily give put on the same pedestal as the people that are bringing the revenue in. So again sort of two different worlds and people that are looking at three different horizons like if we think of the kind of Mckenzes kind of three horizons we have the now maintaining and defending core business we have the near future stuff that you know emerging businesses stuff that's coming up uh future creating innovative new businesses uh sales team obviously looking at maintaining and defending and and selling the now marketing doing a lot of that as well as well as some of the kind of the future facing stuff to generate um demand for future things and of course executives straddling everything because they're looking at the now, they're looking at the next and they're looking at the future as well. And ideally, you want to have the product team primarily focusing on in the nurturing of the emerging stuff and maybe helping a little bit if you see sort of see down here little bit sort of day-to-day help with the existing work but uh but not spending all of their time in the now, spending a lot of the time on the next. In that sort of situation, the executives will be giving sort of vision and strategy to product. The product team will be giving the you know kind of market and and customer awareness to to the marketing team. They'll be working with the sales team who will be giving feedback to the product team but it's very much kind of feedback for the future versus feedback for the now. And this is what you would call kind of a high functioning B2B product company where you have kind of have this relationship of kind of it's it's a virtuous cycle from executives down to sales and background again sales feeding the future of the product uh and selling the present. Uh but what you get often in companies is the kind of the old cliche the feature factory where executives are telling the product team and the marketing team and the sales team what to do. Uh the sales team or in fact pretty much everyone is spending all of their time in the now. Um, no one's particularly worrying about the future yet because it hasn't arrived. And sales are delivering not just feedback and future facing ideas to the product team, but actually making specific demands to the product team uh which they need to make to to sell to sell the to land the deals, sell the product and move forward. And that puts you in this kind of inevitable kind of just almost tactical loop where you're always just building the next thing in the order that it comes up. uh which isn't, you know, necessarily particularly strategic and it does in theory mean that you, as it says at the top, get eaten alive by competitors. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but someday soon for the rest of your life because ultimately pe some people are going to be making those longerterm bets. Uh and unless you kind of cast your eye forward and kind of get out of this sort of now death loop, then eventually you're going to get overtaken. But we do have to obviously go back to the fact that the one metric that matters to these teams is revenue delivered by quarter because that's what they're bonused and incentivized on and potentially fired if they don't u they don't hit. So that then puts us in a in a tricky situation because why would a sales team want to worry about something that might happen in a year's time if you know they might not be here if they don't sell what they've got now. And it's obviously very easy for them to go out and speak to customers who want things and come back and and demand those things. And you know, if that unlocks revenue now, that's that's potentially a good thing because again, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush or whatever that stupid phrase is. But this revenue obsession leads to what I christened and sorry Ed, I think I did come up with it first. this idea of revenue debt uh where companies are chasing a lot of short-term revenue from what you might call the wrong customers, people that maybe aren't good fit or or the product doesn't solve all the problems for. Uh this leads to misaligned revenue which brings in money in the short term but means that the product ends up being kind of bit disconnected because you're having to build various different things in different directions based on the order that salespeople can get conversations with prospects again. So this cash then you end up building too much cash across too many disconnected types of customer because we built something for them and we built something for them and we built something for them and all of a sudden we've got loads of money in each of those pots. But actually the uses and the the kind of use cases and the jobs to be done for all of those different groups is just slightly different and you end up then having to try and build lots of different things to satisfy all these different market segments. locks the company in, makes it harder to evolve the product, makes the product less coherent because your product's gone all over the place now because you just took it deal by deal rather than having a strategy and rather than focusing. So, the only way to get around that is to accept that you may have to take some short-term pain. You may have to fire some customers. You may have to at the very or the very least maybe not fire them, but uh concentrate on certain customers over other customers rather than trying to concentrate on everyone. The problem is, of course, that when you go to a financially minded executive and say, "Hey, we want to lose 20 million in revenue because we're going to fire a bunch of customers," they're immediately going to ask you what your plan is to get that 20 million of revenue back, plus all the extra revenue that you also should have been making at the time. So, it's not, you know, it's a very naive uh product person that goes in and says, "Hey, let's fire 20% of our customer base without having a really coherent kind of well-ec." At the very least, you can sit there and say, "Well, hey, let's do our best to prioritize certain areas more than others because there may be uh you know, higher um potential or higher growth in those areas and try and pair back on some of the areas that maybe you might even consider legacy customers. Yeah, my definition of revenue debt, short-term revenue decisions that create long-term strategic liabilities and inability to say no to disconnected customer requests. One of the things that can happen in situations like this is what what I might call feature firefighting. Yeah. Because the sales team are out there. They're talking to all these people. They're coming back with feature requests and the product team almost then turned into firefighters trying to work out how they how on earth they're going to fit all of these things in at the same time as trying to make strategic pro progress on the product as well, which they're also being incentivized to do. But you might ask, well, why do sales sell feature requests? You know, surely they could just sell quote unquote the product. Well, one of the things that sales people are always told to do in all of their different frameworks is not to sell features, but to sell uh value. You know, what is the value that we're delivering to our to our customers and what difference are we going to make to your business? But not all sales people are doing that. And especially if they're working maybe selling into the enterprise, uh procurement teams almost force people into kind of feature request battles, you know, with check boxes and you if you don't have this feature, you don't get through to the next round. And it's a very difficult thing for sales teams to try to to interrupt that mindset because, you know, procurement pushing people to kind of go up against each other and looking at feature matrices and ticking people off or crossing people off depending on on what they find. Obviously, if uh the revenue or the commission model that the sales teams are are bonused under is focusing very much on revenue now rather than for example customer lifetime value then actually getting customers in as quickly as possible and then moving on to the next customer is actually to them makes a lot of sense. So if those bills come in with a feature request or two or three then you know it makes sense for them to try and load those on because the money is the money. Um there could be sales enablement gaps. could be that the product or the sales team don't really know the best use cases or the best uh you know the best kind of story to tell or the best customers to uh to target with these things. So they end up having to kind of just get dragged into quite tactical conversations with teams. Uh they may be speaking to the wrong people. We talked about this earlier with the uh revenue debt. Like if they're speaking to the wrong people, if they're speaking to the wrong prospects, people that maybe are a little bit poor fit, then that's not uh necessarily a good sign for wanting wanting to sell on value because you're going to get dragged into, oh, well, does it do this or does it do this? And no one ever said that it did do that, but when they're in the conversation, it's a lot less easy to to row back. Uh, but also we got to call out that to on that point, sometimes products do have limitations. I'm not going to say that it's always the product management team's fault. if you want to call it that. Sometimes it's because of this revenue debt situation that the product has kind of evolved into something that solves lots of things not that well or averagely rather than a few things really well. So, you know, I understand how sometimes products get into a state where they maybe do have a few limitations, but we also have to call out that products with limitations are inevitably going to end up coming having features come up in the conversation because they don't do some of the things that they probably should do. But then we sit there and say, well actually on the flip side of that to the previous point as well, is the product management team doing its job? Like was there or has there ever been a product vision or a strategy to achieve that vision? Like many times I'll walk into a company and I and I'll see like a product team that's complaining about, you know, being told what to do by sales or everything being an escalation. That's a fair point. But at the same time, when you ask them what their alternative plan is or their their option that that they would want to do instead, they don't really have one. all they have is that they don't want to do the sales version of that. So, okay, well, that's fine, but you got to put some of the work in to actually show an alternative. Again, to the point, you can't tell someone to fire $20 million of worth of revenue if you don't have an plan, a coherent plan that looks reasonable that might get some of that back. Well, let's face it, all of that back. Um, you know, product management is is the team making good decisions and actually is the product that you're that you're putting out there sellable? Do you even know whether it's sellable? Have you spoken to the sales team and worked out why it does or doesn't sell? I see too many product management teams in these scenarios kind of retreat into the building and the kind of the the managing of the technology and actually not even having a very good idea about whether or how the product is sold. If you don't know that, you can't make good decisions to enable that. Dealing with sales specials. So a sales special as as has has been christened by believe by Rich Mirinov who we'll meet again in a minute is this idea of course of the special feature that comes in when uh when there's a deal on the line and the salesperson comes to you and says we need to have this to win the deal. So you need to have you need to be having lots of conversations with sales. To my earlier point it's very frequent that the sales team does has you know basically no relationship with the product teams at all apart from when there's an escalation or an argument or a fight. I think it's something that we should all do more not just with sales with of course other stakeholders as well but we need to be having more regular conversations. We need to kind of stand up for ourselves to them but also give them a chance to advocate for us and kind of work to to move forward together. Um we need to get visibility into the sales funnel. So like again we're not talking about pirate metrics and acquisition and activation etc. In this case, we're talking about, you know, the marketing qualified leads and sales qualified leads and we're talking about the different pipeline stages that they probably got in in Salesforce or whatever. But in some cases, these sales funnels can be a year long. Like if it's a really big sale, there's no excuse not to have visibility on that. You know, you don't necessarily want to be looking at every day, but you probably want to be looking at it more than whenever there's an escalation. like getting visibility onto the salesunnel is a great way to start to preempt some of the things that are coming up rather than just react to them. Making sure again that you identify potential specials early and that you investigate the requirements. We'll talk about that uh in a sec. Uh and have a a process to do that, which is exactly what we're going to talk about in a sec. Um but by by doing that as well, you can then track what happens with these things. So if you build these things, did it make a difference? Did it win the deal? Did it push stuff over the line? Did it not? And it's also important to make sure that the sales team are aware of what you have done for them because you know recency bias is a thing. It's very common for people to uh you know just remember the last time that you said yes or no to them or or not remember that you've done all these other great things for them. So by tracking things you can then remind people you can kind of let them know let them know that you're on their side and make sure that they realize that that yeah you are a team versus that you're just a person that said no recently but actually you've said yes to them a lot of times before. So should we build that sales special? Everyone loves a quadrant. Uh so in my quadrant here actually this is my my co-conspirator say Khan's quadrant originally that we uh that we put into our sales training. But basically this idea that if we have kind of two axes there of high high let's say high effort versus low effort low alignment with objectives. High alignment with objectives. If it's high high effort and not really aligned with the objectives it sounds like an obvious just say no. Now, obviously, you're going to have to potentially defend that, just say no. But at the same and, you know, sometimes you may get escalated over because of reasons. That's something that then needs to be talked about and and aligned with your your leadership team, your executive team. If there's a good, you know, if it's a a $10 million deal, good luck just saying no. But if it's not, you know, if the cost outweighs the money or the opportunity cost outweighs the money, it should be an easy no. uh if it's highly aligned with your objectives but but also pretty uh high effort, can we simplify this anyway? You know, can we live the agile manifesto? Can we work out a way to to reduce the scope? Can we work out a way to you know deliver some of the value sooner versus trying to just boil the ocean and and deliver everything in in a year's time? Like can we get 80% of the value sooner or or you know is there anything that we can do? Can we pop it up with services, for example, to make sure that people get something sooner and kind of get the deal over the line without having to just derail all of our product development efforts? If it's not really in line with the objectives, but it's not also that hard, not that or the cost doesn't outweigh the benefit, then if it's a particularly influential account or there other benefits, like you know, it's a a loss leader or some kind of lander expand or you get some kind of credibility for winning an account, then maybe you do it. Like, you know, ultimately it's not it's not the end of the world. Uh otherwise, again, it should be an easy no if you can defend it. Uh but if it's highly aligned with the objectives, but not that hard, it could just be a sequencing problem. Like maybe you wanted to do this thing anyway, but it was just something that you weren't going to do yet. So like if there's loads of money on the table and it's something that kind of moves you towards somewhere that you want to be. It's not the worst thing in the world to do that as long as you can make the case that the other things that you were looking at to do before this came up are now going to get moved because obviously some people they succumb to magical thinking and expect that it's all like it's somehow all going to get fit in. Stuff's going to have to move. But if it's something that you were eventually going to get to and it's just an ordering problem, then to some extent you might sit there and say, "Well, fair enough. You know, this sounds like a good idea." So a matrix like this, again, you're going to have to be able to defend your decisions, but it's just a way to think. And you can also try and share this with the uh executive team to you know kind of get their buy in as well to say okay look does this make sense to you like maybe even identifying certain factors that maybe make it you know like the here thing here about influential accounts or other benefits like are there other thing you what are some of the criteria that we might sit there is it about certain sizes of deals is it about certain sizes of customer whatever yeah it's going to be different per company but trying to agree this with the leadership team and and trying to hold them to it is a good first step. Uh and then you can use that as a kind of a discussion point with the sales team. But you do need I mean we talked here about uh objectives. You do need to have objectives. You need to have a vision and a strategy. If you don't have vision and strategy, there's no there's no objectives to measure it against. You need to understand what the market needs. So to so that you can feed that strategy. You need to be able to speak to customers to understand what the feature request is in the first place because you can't necessarily rely on the sales team bringing back a fully fleshed out five wise jobs to be done framework. Like that's not even their job. It's your job. So one of the things you can obviously do is go and speak to the prospects and try to understand the feature request in the first place. But you also need a leadership and product leadership that are you know strongly strong opinions weakly held. You know there's there's a goal. We're definitely going that way. But at the same time how we get there isn't important. If you're in an organization that doesn't believe these things, if if your leadership is expressly telling you that they don't want to operate in in a situation like that, then you know, you have to to some extent embrace the fact that you're in that, you know, quote unquote feature factory that we talked earlier and just get really good at shipping software. Now, that's a decision. It's not a decision for everyone, but at the same time, if you're being told that the company doesn't want any of these things, then it's going to be very difficult to to push back against anything. And that's something you just need to uh understand and accept in your reality. We talked about it, you know, agreeing this with the the leadership team. Make sure that when you're having these escalation meetings that it's not just a free-for-all kind of keep a have some kind of product council or deal review council. Um make sure you hold these meetings on a regular basis. They're regular enough that you're not just or not so regular that you're having conversations all the time, but regular enough that you can kind of keep up with your deal flow. making sure that you do stick to this title. Remove remove the idea of magical thinking. You know, make sure that everything is an or, not an and. You know, tell them what they're not getting. Tell them the impact of not getting that thing and make sure that you agree and write down that agreement. But of course, sales teams are good at escalating. Cover that in a second. So, you do need to have your evidence and you need to have an understanding about like what it is that they're going to get or not get if this happens and try and depersonalize it and and make it based on facts and data as much as possible. Rich Mirinoff, hopefully some of you know Rich, he's got some great stuff. B2B companies hire the most persuasive people that they can to go out and and persuade people to buy our software. And then we're surprised when you tell sales people know that they use those exact same um skills to persuade the CEO or other leaders that you should really be doing that thing. So you're sitting there saying, "Well, we told the sales team no and somehow we've still got escalated over." Well, that's because you've gone up against the most persuasive people in the company. We shouldn't be surprised when they turn those persuasive skills on their own leadership team. So when you do have to say yes, I do think it's important to pick your battles. Like I've seen too many teams and frankly myself as well just burn all of my credibility by trying to fight almost dogmatically such and such a deal that it's like to paraphrase Breaking Bad. Like they made their decision 15 minutes ago. Like there's no way that this isn't going to happen. The best way that you can do or best thing you can do is to try to get through it versus not getting invited to meetings anymore because people think that you're not a serious partner to the business. So you try and judge how much you want to pick a battle over something that where maybe the decision has already been made because if this is way down to the sales process or a big deal may well be too late to try and win them over by quoting bits of inspired at them. You you you may have to try and find a different approach to get through it. Like again if it's a big deal for a strategic deal uh and your job as as I kind of touched on is to get out of the other side intact. The job is to make sure that you can reduce the impact on your road map. Go to that descoping thing. Can we deliver 80% of the value etc. versus um trying to boil the ocean and make sure it doesn't happen too often. Like ideally you want to kind of get ahead of the wave. You want to get ahead of the sales wave. We think of that earlier uh chart that we were looking at where we saying that in a feature factory they're doing this but in a well functioning company doing this. We want to get away from the feature factory. We want to start to understand and build things before people are asking for them, not after that they're asking for them. So, you know, that takes time, but that's the way to get out of it is to make sure that you're ahead of that sales wave rather than always playing catch-up. So, if you do get such a a feature request, it's important uh first of all to speak to the sales team. Make sure that you're not taking things at face value. Make sure that you kind of dig in a little bit to try and understand what they believe that request is. You need to speak to the prospect. you need to speak to the people that have allegedly made this request because ultimately even in like I'm sure we're all aware of you know B2B companies where we're not um given access to customers you know we're not allowed to do discovery it's quite common in a salesled B2B organization but this is a great chance to go and speak to the customer or the prospect the prospective customer because you can sit there and say well look we want to go and find out we want to go and talk to them and make sure that the solution meets their needs and what that really gives you a chance to do is to dig into it and understand what they really need and how important it really is and whe there are any workarounds. Maybe the sales team didn't know about the workarounds. It's a great chance to get out in front of a prospect. Review your evidence. What other customers have asked for this? Do you have any other supporting evidence in your product board or whatever solution that you're using? Is this something that you wanted to do anyway? Do you have any kind of market analysis or any other discovery that tells you that this is a good idea? Can you how simple can you start? We talked about descoping like what's the simplest version of this that we can deliver? We don't have to boil the ocean all at once. We can certainly deliver something to get that deal over the line. That will keep the sales team happy because the deal will move forward. It will keep the customer happy because they'll be getting a large maj amount of the value from the smaller solution potentially propped up by a service team, customer support teams can maybe help them with some of the bits that you didn't build yet. But at least it moves things forward and and you look you're looking like you're making progress rather than just holding people up. and then potentially productize it later. Like sometimes these are great ideas that maybe should be part of your product. Maybe you build a small solution as a as a starting point, you productize it later, becomes a part of your general offering, something that you can release to the masses. So like it's not necessarily a bad idea idea just because a customer came up with it. It's important to realize that sometimes, you know, good ideas start with something simple and then become better things as you do a bit more research afterwards. It's always important to uh to follow a process. I think that too many people when they get some kind of feature request, they they'll just take that feature request and they'll just build that feature request and that's it. Done. Move on to the next thing. If you're doing that, then I'm going to probably again spicily argue that you're not really doing a great product management job in that or you're probably doing a good business analysis job, probably doing a good project management job. uh but I think that the best product teams out there that have the best relationships with sales will follow a process like this to actually go out and start to understand where this is coming from and why. Other ways you could mitigate it. It's a systemic problem. Like again, if your company wants to operate like this, then it's a that's a whole different kettle of fish. You you can't change an entire company's mindset probably on your own. All you can do is try and demonstrate and show the impact that this is having on, you know, both the current stuff that you're building plus the the longer term scenarios that you can plan out and show like, well, if we can going to keep going on like this, this is what we believe is going to happen. But, you know, to to fix the system is is a big deal, but you know, you can certainly try and make certain small uh adjustments where you can. So, for example, allocating percentages of time, treating things as a portfolio, potentially carving out x% of your time for special requests because you know that's what's going to come up. Good luck defending the percentage, by the way. But at the same time, at least it puts you in a mindset where we've got maybe we're going to make strategic progress at 80% of the velocity that we believe we could and 20% of our time is going to be carved out for for such and such because that's just the type of business we are, the type of market we're in, type of customers that we have. You could limit to certain percentage or certain sizes of revenue. You could prop it up with uh services or support or partners. You know, I've worked in companies where we had an API that we just opened up to partners and we had certified partners that could just build stuff around our product. We never had to worry about it. They just used our APIs. It's a great way to to build things in a way that people can extend themselves rather than you have to build everything kind of on spec when it comes in. I say here it's a marathon, not a sprint. ch changing how salesdriven companies work and kind of changing the product sales relationship. It takes time. There's a hearts and minds thing going on here. There's lots of work you need to do to kind of work back from these feature requests and it's important to uh to not lose heart. But there are things that you can do straight away. You can speak to the sales team. Like you should speak to the sales team. Like I again I said earlier like the amount of teams that I go into where the companies that I go into where the the product and the sales team just just ain't speaking. It's it's unbelievable and it needs to happen. You take them out for a coffee, go and chat to them, find out what's motivating them, find out what's on their mind. Tell them what's on your mind. Try and build a relationship with these people rather than just shouting at each other across the wall whenever anything goes wrong. Build better feedback loops. Make sure that whilst you're not saying that you're going to go and build everything that they say as soon as they say it, make sure that you're listening to them. make sure that you're getting their their feedback into a structured format like whatever tool that you use maybe using AI now to kind of mine the feedback to come up with trends that are that are emerging or making sure that you're not leaving things letting things fall through the craps the the craps the cracks um make sure that you aren't in a situation where people feel that they're just flinging feedback into a black hole and and they never hear about any of that again it's important to make sure you have good feedback loops it's just a different type of discovery we sit complaining about discovery all the time and we should be doing discovery but we should also be taking back all the different types of feedback and uh and input that we can from everywhere and making sure that we bring that into our thinking as well. We talked about the feature request framework. We should absolutely do that. Uh deal review meetings are an important thing to try and do as well. So deal review meetings where you we talked about it earlier the idea that you should be you should have visibility on your pipeline. You should know what's coming down the pipe. You should identify types of signal that a deal might be worth reviewing and you should talk to the sales team directly about these deals on a regular basis so that you can you can let them know what they should expect and they can let you know what you should expect. Um you should participate in win loss analysis. Make sure that you actually understand why you win or lose, why your product does or doesn't sell. Now this also requires the sales team to have good metadata and feedback and stuff that they put into the CRM. But it's important to understand that you can't make good decisions about making your product better or more sellable if you don't understand why people aren't buying it. So making sure that you participate in that and and kind of get them to get their house in order. And you know, if you have a revops team, that's a great way to do that as well. Bring them together, make sure you understand why people are or are not buying what you're trying to sell them. Uh ideal customer profiles. It's all I mean, everyone should have one. uh often the ideal customer profile appears to be just everyone. One of the things that you can do if you do have a lot of kind of sales history is you can actually start to mine that sales history. Start to understand who your actual best customers are. Who you have the shortest sales cycle lengths with. You know who buy you what the what the highest win rate is. You can start to understand which customers are actually your best customers based on all the data that you have about the customers that you've already sold to or lost to. So whilst it's always better to start off with an ideal customer profile, you can start to propose changes to who you're targeting based on data that maybe no one's ever even looked at. So it could be, you know, it should be part of your job to go and try and work out where this product really fits the best. And get involved in sales enablement. Like we talked about a sales pipeline. It's it's inevitable that there are going to be parts of that, you know, stages in that sales pipeline that are slower than others. And some of those are not solvable problems because it's to do with the the behaviors of the buyers. But some of them maybe it could be that the product doesn't demo well enough. Maybe it's that the product doesn't have that one feature that would just make it easier to sort of show the value and get people past that stage sooner. So I'm not going to say that the product team can solve every single source slow part of the of the of the salesunnel, but at the same time you should check and you should understand what parts of the salesunnel are slower and which are faster and try and identify what you can do to actually help this you because if you can't sell the product if the if the sales team can't sell the product for you, you've either got to make it fully productled growth and and you know good luck with that or you've got to try and find a way to help them. You can't just sit back, throw stuff over the wall, and just expect the sales team to say it. You've got to get involved. Very last slide. Uh there's actually, if you look at this uh link, and there's a scan thingy there as well, uh QR code. There's a there's a free sales assessment that you can take, which will show you ask you a bunch of questions. You don't have to put an email address in. You don't have to give any personal details. It's completely free and anonymous, but you can answer a few short questions. It will tell you what your overall sort of product sales relationship is like and what your weakest area is and give you some sort of canned advice that you can use to maybe start try and make a difference. >> Jason, thank you. That was that was fantastic. I have a question myself. I was just thinking that you've got so many kind of great practical bits of advice there. If if someone is at the start of their journey and they haven't got any any real relationship with sales, could you suggest a kind of a simple format for a product sales alignment meeting or something like that which would be a a kind of a good a good kind of first step? >> Yeah. So I mean aside from my my general advice of look go and talk to them, have a cup of coffee and etc. you know, just to actually build a relationship like a good a good kind of first step is to if you can identify for example what you think a deal of interest is. So for example, a certain size or a certain market or needs certain features or it's a certain subset of a whatever like work with the sales team to work out what deals tend to or you know obviously you can look at your past history as well but like what types of deal deserve attention or what types of deal things come up for. You can then use that to say okay well if if a deal meets any of these criteria we want to talk about it and we want to talk about it in an open fashion on let's say a monthly basis you can get the like you you get the sales the sales rep in uh or you know the head of sales whoever it is that wants to come and talk about it obviously the sales rep would be the best person because they're closest to the deal and just ask a bunch of structure you know first of all obviously how's it going any updates uh any any feedback from the prospects any any kind of uh areas that you're not sure about any areas that maybe you need clarification on any questions about the product or is there anything that you need to move you to move the uh the thing along to to move it to the next stage? Uh and are there any basically are there any requirements or any kind of indications of requirements coming up so that we can start to first of all let you know like okay yeah that it absolutely does do that or it absolutely doesn't or we need to go away and investigate that and we'll get back to you by X. So, I mean, that's kind of off the top of my head, but that's the kind of those that's the kind of process I would want to go through. Identify what makes a deal worth investigating. Uh, and then set up a structured meeting where you you speak through deals that kind of hit that trigger point. Uh, and then either answer it in in the moment or go back and and find them afterwards once you've done the investigation. >> Yeah, super. Thanks very much. How big a part do you think organizational design and culture plays in the relationship between sales and product? From experience, trying to build these relationships with sales and gradually improve the processes is very challenging when the culture itself promotes salesdriven feature factories. Are there important factors beyond the individual level here? >> Yeah, I think it's I mean one of the things that we said earlier is like you know some some some companies are not going to change. There are companies out and I've worked with companies out there where it's like literally whatever whatever we need to do for the next deal is absolutely what we're next we're going to do and no matter how I tried to persuade them of the potential benefits of doing things in a different way uh they just haven't that's like it's just part of the DNA of the company. Now, I'd like to think and and maybe this is also a failing of mine, but you know, in in in some cases that that there's always an argument that could be made, but obviously the argument that needs to be made isn't so much, oh yeah, we should be more producty. It's we believe that doing these things in a different way will deliver better financial returns to the company. We believe that you will be you will sell more if you do these things and we believe it because this uh or this is the evidence that we have so far. But of course, if you've got, you know, a leadership team who who've kind of hired a a a bunch of kind of hunter killer salespeople that just go out there and hit their rolodexes and just try and sell to whomever and that's just how they do it. And there's almost no kind of rigor around who they're going after and no playbook. Yeah, you need for example a good head of sales, chief revenue officer, someone like that. You need a good partner. Whoever whoever's leading sales and of course that could be one of the founders too. You need them to actually believe at least conceptually that doing things in a different way is going to be is going to deliver results. Now obviously the longer and this goes to the revenue debt point. the longer you're sitting there selling to anyone and getting all these different buckets of money in from everyone, the the longer or the harder it's going to be to unpick because as per the revenue debt thing, you end up with too much money in each pot that they can't then just say, "Well, we don't want that money anymore." No one's going to sit there and let all of those people churn. But of course, what tends to happen in situations like that is eventually they kind of churn anyway because just maybe later they they they eventually churn because they they finally get fed up of the fact that that somehow the product's never quite good enough compared to what they were told. Uh but that could be a long way down down the line. So I do think culture is a big part of it. If you've got people who are just like, you know, I've worked in places where it's like literally whenever anything came in, any request from any any customer, it was just like, "Yeah, yeah, we could do that. We got a good team. We could do that." So, okay, great. Well, if you if that's the approach that you want to take, if you don't want to have a vision and a strategy, if you just want to go after every single opportunity, maybe you'll accidentally build a great product out the back of it because, you know, somehow you actually by by, you know, more luck than judgment, the order of the things that comes in is the the right order. But, uh, I don't think that's necessarily a great prioritization tactic. the order that a salesperson can get a meeting with a customer that's not a great way to prioritize. That's worse than rice. You know, that's just a it's just kind of based on happen stance. So if they but if they you have this discussion with them, if you say to them like this is where we believe we should go. These are where we believe our best customers are. This is the how we know that because we've you know done some analysis and we've worked out that actually these people we sell to in half the time and they retain for longer. The total lifetime or the customer lifetime value of these is this and this is that. If you can do some of that analysis and it bounces off them, you got a much bigger problem than than running a deal review meeting. Again, I think what too many people try to do is try and win it on the fundamentals of like product being productled. Hey boss, we don't we don't really like the sales team coming and talking to us and asking us to do stuff. Um, can we not do that anymore? And they're like, well, okay, but what kind of argument is that? That's not that's not helpful because it doesn't frame it in a way that that that matters to them. I always like to say that when you're trying to solve a problem or trying to persuade someone you need to solve a problem, you need to persuade them in terms of it being a problem that they already cared about versus trying to persuade them to care about a new thing that they weren't thinking about before. No C no salesdriven CEO is carees too much about whether you're doing continuous discovery or whether you're doing assumption mapping or, you know, following a a hustle badger template or whatever. And they don't care. None of them care. But they do care that certain cohorts of people are not retaining or that you know the upsell potential is lower because of whatever reason. They they care that deals close slower or or faster or that they're not being able to live up to commitments they made in the past because of the continued commitments that they're making in the future. Yeah, I remember working at one place where the uh the thing that really kind of the straw that broke the camel's back was realizing that they've made so many of these well they' kind of moved so fast there was such a need for professional services to set people up that it was actually taking weeks or months to get people on to the system after they sold it to them because they never invested in some of the areas that the product team said that they should have invested in. And it was only when they stopped being able to to sell new business because the lead time was such that people wouldn't sign the contract anymore that all of a sudden the leadership team, oh yeah, we should probably fix that now. So sometimes you need to try and find there's this kind of concept of an Overton window like where where things move from being unthinkable to inevitable. Like find the events that happen that that prove that you're right about a thing and use that as leverage to say well actually we don't want this thing to happen anymore. you definitely don't want this thing to happen anymore. If we do so, if we invest some some time into this area, it could make this thing not happen or less likely to happen in the future, which means that in theory, because it's then resonating with them because it's something that they've just seen, it could give you permission to try and make, you know, make a small move. >> Yeah. Yeah. Great. And as I say, this is just the first of many talks. If you've got people you'd like us to hear from or got any feedback on the session, please do let us know. But thank you very much, Jason, for coming along. It's been um fantastic. That was like super dense just in terms of insights and feedback. >> Sorry about that. >> Um no, no, no. That was amazing. That that that was great. Thank you so much.
