Well, I I think we can get going on some of the general stuff if that's all right for you, John. Um, my name is Susanna. I am one of the co-founders of Hustlebadger. I know everyone's much more used to Ed, but here I am. Uh, I'm the other one. I do all the boring stuff like finance. Um, quick note on Hustlebger. If you haven't heard of us, we are online education for folks working in product founders and increasingly anybody interested in AI. Uh we've got a wiki online courses uh and we've been scaling up over the last three years. You can check out our website hustlebadger.com which helpfully we have all over John's lovely sides. Just some quick housekeeping notes. Um we are recording the call uh and we'll make sure that we shoot you an email afterwards with some materials to do a little recap of what we've covered today. uh so that if you have to drop off or anything like that uh you'll still get the information. Um and yeah, but now for for really the main event, the thing that everybody came for, which is John, uh who has come to teach us how to cope with the messy including all of our own, which are uh to briefly intro him, he's uh an ex meta product leader. He's also held CPO roles at Dex, Spring of Nature, and Elliptic, but I'm sure John has has a little bit say about himself as well. Uh, I'll be handling any questions. Shoot them into the chat as we go through. Uh, and John will be presenting. Over to you, John. >> Cool. Very good. Thank you very much. I speak very fast, so I shall be attempting to speak slower. Drop in the chat if I become unintelligible. I watched Dave Colleen recently explain that he was just going to go at 100 miles an hour and make no apology. So, I should also try to speak reasonably fast and get through the content. Um, who am I? My own experience spans absolute startups. So I did, you know, just from zero, am I unemployed or am I doing something amazing through to billion dollar portfolio at spring of nature, big tech at Meta, Scrappy Scaleups, that was Dex and Olympic. I'm going to talk mainly about antiatterns. Um I think that's more interesting. I want to see what I share what I've seen go wrong. Uh how I've watched people uh including myself uh go wrong. So uh some big caveats up front. Um everyone here might be at different levels. Uh, some of you are responsible for making product work. Some of you are looking up at someone who you blame for product not working in your company. Um, you may be a beacon of best practice that your data science team isn't uh, great. You may be wishing you had just one data scientist. Um, I'm going to speak from my experience and it may or may not resonate or be of use to you. I'll try to avoid being generic. Uh, and I'm almost certainly going to be wrong about things. Um, so hopefully the Q&A will be interesting. So what are we going to talk about? Uh, three things. Three should be the number of the topics. Uh, number one, things you may be saying that infuriate, annoy, and discourage the very people you need to win over, which has been casually titled why Marty Kagan may have accidentally make you insufferable. H, number two, accepting will take much longer than you ever thought. Uh, but feeling better about it because nearly everybody else is in the same boat. otherwise known as fixing what's in front of you while still dreaming big. And the third and final one will be how to tell if you're in the right company or not. Um, I've got no set formula here, but some nudges to help you decide whether you should stay or go. So, let me see if I can advance these slides. Yes, here we go. Okay, so number one, topic one, insufferable, uh, inspired, empowered, and insufferable. It sounds like a credible member of the book series. Um, many PMs, hopefully not you, maybe not you, uh, fresh from the latest batch of Kool-Aid, uh, will often willfully go on a kick your colleagues campaign. The CEO, CMO, CROO, and CFO are part of the problem. Their influence over product, being inherently misguided, they can't help but be wrong. It's in their nature. A new world order is needed with product on top. tech may or may not be allowed into the right side of the camp or they may be kept with the them in the them and us war of enlightened versus the short termist foes. All this despite the fact the product may not know their customers well. Uh sales might actively have blocked you because they don't want you to uh ruin an upcoming deal. There's no analytics in place. Your metrics, even if available, can't be tied back to revenue through some aligned pricing scheme. Your PN's only recently learned what P&L means and you're looking to be crowned king while the rest of the org feels they have to survive despite you. Uh to be clear, I'm not criticizing Marty. I think that'd be career suicide. So I'm not going to engage in Harry Carry on this webinar, but um I think a lot of what he says gets misinterpreted if I'm being kind. So he says product teams need autonomy and some here ignore the CEO's constraints. He says product should report to the CEO. Some hear marketing and sales are the enemy. He says focus on output outcomes not outputs. Some hear this as never commit to timelines. H there's a trio that he suggested the PM and designer and engineer and that is heard by some to mean sales and marketing don't get a vote. Empowered teams make decisions. We don't have to explain our choices to leadership. Missionary not mercenary. Some here caring about revenue is selling out. So in the extreme this leads to some seeing product a lot of people seeing product this way. First and foremost selling the concept of we can say nothing about anything. We have to wait and see. Meanwhile the CRO CMO are acutely aware of the next funding round or earnings call and are moving heaven and earth to make sure those hard take hard hard targets are hit come rain or shine. Uh, you're hiking out hard in the sailing analogy for the theory of how things should be, having ignored all the caveats and prerequisites for success. You're chasing metrics no one's bought into, while the CEO feels gaslit for caring about how your road map will contribute to paying everyone's wages. If you're a junior PM and your CPO hasn't built the bridge from the CFO forecast through to the CTO spend, you'll really struggle to do it at the individual team level. You'll end up making nonsense revenue forecasts no one believes in, including you, killing your credibility, and making you feel even worse about yourself. Hopefully, some of that you may recognize in yourself or others. Many are filled with the zeal of knowing what they're selling is right, but from a position where they things are not working and you're not entirely sure how to do it. Don't put yourself outside the camp. looking down on others for not doing it right. Stay close to the rest of the team and stay humble. Get buy in to what needs to be fixed. Check the product transformation vision you are selling has product market fit. And above all, show empathy. Things are not going to work first time and you need to make sure that you're not being arrogant and you're not being overconfident because when that first fall comes, you're going to need to have people still supporting you. I've now done a few product org and company level transformations. Uh it does get easier but equally the world is changing very fast and it's always been true that what worked at one company uh may not work in another and what worked in the past may not work now. Uh when I started the V model for all of you who know that the V model was taught best practice. It told you every day spent in a detailed specification will save you 5 days down the line. a textbook waterfall. I can remember working for Accenture and I had lever arch files next to me multiple hundred pages long that we were incredibly proud of system and product specs. That doctrine was being absolutely derided later. Now rapid AI prototype prototyping is all the rage. Soon it will unleash a rash of guerilla IT upon us as the uncertainty ramps up and no one's quite sure how things should be done. listening and keeping people with you will be more important than ever. So number one don't be insufferable if you can diagnose it in yourself or others uh sorted out. Topic two fixing what's in front of you while dreaming big uh which I have got uh this is like a demo for um Nano Banana. So this is somebody mired up to their waist while staring at the stars. Okay. So if topic one was don't be insufferable, don't be an insufferable zealot. H looks down everyone. Topic two is more about well how do you make you where you work more profit friendly? How do you move things the right way? Uh there are no end of books out there with endstep processes and frameworks or you can just ask AI and it'll give you a credible answer can buy in the best of every expert ever. Uh what I want to tell you is it takes a long time. Carlotta from GIFGAF did a great talk here a while back. Um, and she said it takes months and then quickly follow that up with uh that that meant 18 months. Uh, and I'm guessing likely years to get to something reflecting book breast practice. You need patience both with yourself and your colleagues. Um, I'm a very impatient person. I always want everything to be better, faster. I'm never happy with how things are. Uh, but you need to pace yourself. Uh, to make this a bit more interesting, uh, let's look at how not to do it. So number one advanced banana banana. Okay. So uh cross functional teams with no one from GTM in them. Uh your north star when you're doing this has like got zero currency with the CEO and CFO. Uh you've created a product team and tech team happy space uh and look more disconnected than ever. People are looking over to the corner wondering why you're smiling and and um feeling happier when they have no idea what you're up to. and you're probably under underindexing on customer and pricing considerations. Um, you might be taking for granted that happier users will translate to value. Uh, maybe your buyer hates their users. You know, you might be doing the equivalent of giving call center managers nice big fluffy headphones for their staff, beautiful leather ones. What the call center manager wants is ones that are wiped clean and are never stolen, that are so undesirable that they don't walk out the door. Um, you might think that your customer should care. Uh, you might be advocating that key RFP requirements, you know, shouldn't be there, but they are. Uh, so please, please, please, please, please make sure that you do a selfch check. Are you happily excluding GTN? Don't. You'll need them for success uh to ultimately be a success. In the interim, maybe you'll be all right, but ultimately it won't work. H in my own experience, you'll tend to struggle to get them involved. They probably tell you that they've got no time. They're too busy. Maybe they're too busy plugging revenue gaps from product that never shipped. Um they may not know how to engage. H their incentives may be too short term to care about contributing to anything that's a few weeks out, never mind two quarters out. Uh but don't find happiness in isolation. Like the dancer at the top of this uh this uh hourglass, do not find happiness in isolation. It is not success. It is just delayed failure. you need to build the bridge to GTM and beefing up product marketing will probably help a lot. I sent this to somebody actually h yesterday and I said yes we you know that's what we need to build product marketing we don't have it we have to build it it's going to how we're going to get our bridge okie do number two advance banana banana failing fast and forgetting why that's useful so people need hope and the value of failing fast is moving on to better ideas uh you need alternatives to jump to to feed the engineering and revenue beasts that are waiting and ready to be fed. Uh and then people without options tend to conclude that the one option they have is okay. Uh I remember a great talk mind the product fairly sure uh where a speaker asked if everyone believes in fail fast. Everyone's hands shot up. Of course I do. I read the book. She then asked who has killed a product and no few hands left. She then asked who researched products one at a time and whether people thought that was an issue for the willingness to discover bad outcomes. It it really really hit hard. H it was a great talk. It brought home to me that most people and myself included at the time were not ready to fail fast. So by way of a selfch check selfch check. Do you have a 1:1 ratio between things you're researching now and things you'll build next period? Uh don't. That's wildly dangerous. you're highly likely to conclude that that's what you should go ahead with. You're not prepared to fail fast. Accelerate research faster to make sure you aren't painting yourself into a corner. At at Dex, I worked with Danielle McDonald, who's now at Google, and Divid Hughes, who's now at Meta. And they both fabulous people. If you ever get a chance to work with them, please do. They transformed how we approached the investigation of new products. Before we spent all our time and effort on postmortems. Why did this fully built feature fail? We had no bandwidth for anything else. Even if it was clear why it failed, the emotions and disbelief are so high, you're forced to spend a lot of time on it. Uh for, you know, fans of Monty Python, are you sure the pirate is dead? Yes, the pirate is dead. Please double check. So, we flipped things around uh much more on exploring fit earlier made a big difference. The emotional drain of working on something you feel is going to fail is a disaster. The confidence to push through bugs and setbacks when you believe in the macro idea is huge. But even then, we still made the mistake of having too few things in the hopper. Too much love for a chosen child. So, you know, be ready to fail fast. Have things ready to go. Be willing to switch when you find out negative outcomes. Number three, there's only four of these. So number three which is a halfbuilt greenhouse with all the plants inside it which Nana Banana did a reasonably good job of of instantly creating in this world of AI. Uh key skill of finding uh PowerPoint images gone gone from the world no longer needed. Nan just does it. You're selling long-term exclusively when the world just does not work that way. Rich mega corporations can wait for user love to translate to revenue. your ordinary size company probably can't. Um, you need to engage with short-term realities. Uh, you need to deliver on what matters to the company, not what you think should matter. Now, here's where I find a lack of a macro mapping of revenue through pricing to product initiatives really hurts. Instead of falling into the trap of being overly precise about things you're unsure of, use the swim lanes of investment bets approach. Divide all your spend bandwidth into board level objectives. For example, churn prevention and account health, new product development for sold separately, offerings, bugs and tech debt, etc. Defend why 20% is on NPD and why 30% is on account health. Have the argument with the CFO, CEO, CRO about what is right. No one knows what's right, but have the argument about what's right and agree what you're going to bet on, what you're going to go with, and go back and for it and own it jointly. Then separately debate whether the money is being spent well. Okay, there two separate questions. Bet on this. Are you making the executing the bet correctly? Um, so quick self check for everyone out there. Do you know the company's cash dynamic, revenue targets, key KPIs for the board and investors? Do you think others are wrong for caring about them too much? Winning in business requires balancing many things. Like in a video game, you need to collect the gold rings whilst keeping your health up and not being eaten by ghosts. business is very very similar. You can't just obsess about one thing and hope it'll come good in the long term. Except that there are short-term goals that need to be honored. Challenge them, but challenge them as you build credibility. There was a great phrase I heard at MET which was learn the game, win at the game, change the game in that order. Attempting to do it in any other order will not work. You have to understand the game. You have to excel at the game before you have the right to say, "I want to change the game. Number four, the last one in this area, not fixing delivery. I shall explain this strange picture as we go through. Um, confusing resisting feature factory with defending slow answering all milestone questions with agile says I can't say closing down questions on efficiency and overlook and looking over the defensive forgetting you need to be fast to win as well as build the right things. You know that the kind of phrase that execution eats strategy for breakfast. You have to be fast. You have to get that bit right. So allow for independent scrutiny of engineering excellence alongside product excellence. Don't defend what's not yours to defend. You may think it's a secondary concern, but do not dismiss or deny the validity of the concern. Often times people want to kick technology through product. They don't want to go direct. they've run out of the energy to do it. So they want you to do it. Okay. And then sometimes you need to defend technology in order to you know have a functioning workplace but ensure you allow for that scrutiny. It's very very healthy. Very very healthy. You're not going to get anywhere if you don't have a good delivery engine. So selfch check. Are you being defensive? Do you think allowing a conversation about speeding up delivery will prevent or delay doing product right? Delivery can always be better. allow efficiency and efficacy to be pursued in parallel. Blocking one will build distrust and dysfunction. Now to this picture, a good friend of mine at Accenture, he said, "John, on this project, we have turned up at a car crash to sell a car stereo. The car is wrapped around the pole and we are like, you like a car stereo?" Um, selling a car nowadays, the infotainment system is one of the biggest differentiators. It's why people choose cars based on the infotainment system. But that is assuming that the rest of the car works. Okay. Uh you may be very interested in some areas of product excellence, but you have to have a competent delivery engine. Okay? That has to be working. So just make sure that you're focused on the right things. You may love all the books. Uh do not be selling a car stereo to a crash car. Uh I saw at Elliptic when we unblocked delivery, the transformation it made. There was one product that had been stuck in work in progress for far too long and nobody wanted to listen to us until it shipped and no one did listen to us really until it chipped. It's like a hangry person, you know, you need to give them the sneakers and there was no good reason why it hadn't shipped. If there's anyone for an indicator that there were other reasons, but I'm going to simplify simplify for the sake of the story. Same with Dex. Once we fixed velocity by refactoring some of the code base and adopting more modern stack, everything became easier. all of our conversations became easier. So, if you're falling into these traps, leaving GTM out, not being ready to fail fast, selling long-term exclusively, not fixing delivery, I'd say just reverse. Get out of those traps. They're a terrible, terrible place to be. So, where is the the hopeful part, the dreaming part, the the looking at the stars part, uh doing a whole pile of negative things? I think it's more important to try to diagnose the negative things and get out of them. It's very easy to fall into them. But the hopeful part is that knowing nearly everyone else is in in the same boat and that can keep you patient. Your team, your company, your CEO is not uniquely terrible. In fact, the companies in the book are the exception. Um, all the PMs in those perfect companies have much easier jobs than you. Read the report which test won. be double clever and check for statistical significance. All good, easy, easy peasy. Versus wait for the next RFP result, conclude nothing concrete. Discover all last year's data was incorrectly tagged, but even if it wasn't, it was too low anyway. It wouldn't have made a difference. The great stories are people who do great things against adversity. Be thankful. You most likely have plenty of adversity. Uh maybe loads of it. Relish it. you likely won't have got the you wouldn't have got the job if the company was perfect. Let's let's be fair. Okay. So, it's a one amazing opportunity to work through the things that are broken. In meta, I saw the power of everyone hunting one goal. Uh no separate product technology and GTM strategies. Just one strategy. One goal. No bloated processes. Just honest assessment of whether our goal was right and whether we were on track to hit it. The very first meeting I was in, I remember I had to double check people's rules because the head of engineering was saying things like, "By my estimation, we should be at 97 million and we're at 92." Now, can anyone explain to me here whether it's a pacing issue and I shouldn't have assumed a linear progress or whether there's something else going wrong? And I was checking is he is he head of engineering? Is he head of product? And the people who were able to answer is engineers. Everyone understood exactly what we were going for. It was eye openening. I have been so used to people saying well you know product and the business want to do this but we want to do that and you're both sort of trying to marry these two separate things and not really going around one goal. They were so good at just one common goal. Everyone able to explain it. Springer nature. I saw the power of persistence sticking with it when you've lost sight of how the hell you're going to get through it. It took twice as long to get half as far as I'd hoped. But the sense of achievement was huge because the learning you get from seeing things through when you can't easily see a path through is huge. You gain belief in yourself. You gain belief in others. I'll come back to spring nature later when we talk about whether you're in the right company or not. At elliptic index, I learned the complex balancing act necessary to defend your engineering department's delivery and the power of scrutiny to improve things. I saw the power of fixing small things and the credit advis you for selling bigger change. Above all, where I've seen success is where everyone knows why they are changing approaches and processes and not simply adopt something they've been told worked. Know why. Stick to the why. Don't worry too much about the latest framework. You know, it it's heartbreaking to see a company of a 100 people with 200 OKRs knowing that nobody has ever read them. No one believes in any of them and everyone is just waiting to figure out how they're going to step back from them. Okay? So, know the why. Stick to first principles. Especially in this day and age when everything is changing, understand first principles. Stick with them. We are into our final topic and then the Q&A can can go. Hopefully I'm not I'm not going too fast today. We'll lower economics. So topic three, how to tell if you're in the right company or not. Okay, so some tips, check your strategic alignment. If you have VC style ambitions, but you're PE backed, you may be tugging in the wrong direction. You may want to swing for the fences and be the number one globally in your category, but the balance sheet aligned plan calls for a good enough suite of products sold through a common channel. Neither is right or wrong as a strategy, but if you're not aligned to the company's strategic choice, you need to change company or change strategy. I told this to somebody once said, "Yeah, you're right, John. I know." And I said, "Well, you know, what are you going to do about it?" And you know, the the answer was to like willfully hope the company changes strategy. The company's not changing strategy. The balance sheet is set. The die is cast. You know that you're the problem. So, if you need to jump, jump. Second tip, don't learn alone. Learning on the job from others is so much easier than from a book of webinars. If you're lonely, if you've been flattered into the wrong role with a big title, seek learning. Take a junior role in a bigger team. We're in a difficult jobs market, ever, so don't treat and move flippantly. Uh you can try and offset loneliness by seeking out peers in other companies and helping them work through problems and work through your own problems too. People are remarkably open to this. Most people don't seem to avail of this, but you can find another peer in a different company, not a competitor, and just get their view on your problem and help them with their problem. And often times you'll find as you give them advice and walk through the best practice, you know, and understand, you realize you're following none of it yourself. And that re-energizes you to go back in. So, seek learning. It's a cliche, but it's very, very true. um much easier if you are earlier in your career to go in with a bigger team and learn from them too if possible. Not always possible. Three, not everyone has it easier. Uh if you think everyone has it easier, your CEO is uniquely bad, your investor is uniquely unenlightened, the grass must be green on the other side, then hold your horses. Uh doing it right is hard. It takes time. Your job is to bring people together to build consensus. uh not just find people who are pre-aligned. Okay. So, the fact that it's a I'm trying to come up with the polite way of saying this. The fact that it's a bit of a mess h is normal. It's not that you're going to go next door and it's going to be all great. Also, the fact that it's a bit of a mess, as I said earlier, is your opportunity. You know, if everyone's pre-aligned, there isn't a role for you. Aligning them, that's your opportunity. So don't run away from that seeing that as a problem, a prerequisite that need to be met. No, that's just the job. And lastly, culture and values matter. If you can't stand the people, not what they say, but how they say it, if you don't respect the values and culture, then pick better next time and get out when it makes sense to move. But if you're being an insufferable zealot, you know, people may be reacting to you in understandable ways. So check yourself and make sure that you're not actually putting people off and not getting reflected back to you. Um there was a a friend once he rang me up and he said, "John, I've just been offered the job of my dreams. I think it was like 70k. I'm going to get to do uh work I did in my PhD. I absolutely love it. People are lovely. And I'm wrapped. I can't figure out how to decide because this other company, Evilcore, have offered me 75K, 5K more h to work on something I have no interest in whatsoever, you know. I was like, are you I didn't know if he was joking. I didn't know it was a wind up. It is very hard for people to actually value values, you know. Um, so just make sure when you've written down your values and you've figured out what it is that you want that you actually ascribe proper value to them. Sometimes that will come at a cost. Doesn't always come at a cost, but I've witnessed many people just fail to make that choice and then inevitably things don't work out as you might expect. Um, I still come back to Springer Nature. So I've seen the value of doing what you don't want to do or didn't want to do. Um, I joined Springer Nature and my cheese was moved so hard I had no idea where my cheese was. Never mind where the the fridge was. Uh, I joined to transform the scientific publishing industry to radically overhaul it, attack the big beasts um, and instead I ended up doing post merger integration um, to help shore up a um, not what I'd signed up for, but a very very interesting problem. And once I accepted that actually the problem was hard, it was something that I'd be able to use in the future and properly reset, I was okay with it. You know, going in and being able to cope with imperfections makes you relevant to 99% of the world, not the 1% of the world that's already sorted it all out. If you're having difficulty with aligning orgs and all that sort of good stuff, maybe step back, see if that's a problem worth solving. nothing's in the way and then if you can attach to that problem it's a proper good PM problem and maybe that'll make you a bit happier where you are. So in conclusion before we move to the Q&A and we have plenty of time uh check yourself before you wreck yourself um if you're making enemies of people by being an insufferable person don't. You're missing the point. Most PMs are nice people. We're a lovely group of people. Stay inside the camp. Stay humble and bring people with you. Second, takes years, not months. Everyone else is struggling. The companies in the book are outliers. Be patient with yourself and others. If it was easy, it would be boring. I have no desire to work on easy problems. It's horribly boring. The second I know how to solve something, I almost lose interest in doing it. Um, and also just don't take things too personally. Uh, you need to be okay when the project is not okay, when the company's not okay. I've seen people have a keel, you know, big heavy thing at the bottom of the boat. Helps even things out. Even out your own emotions. Don't put all of your selfworth into your job, which hopefully you aren't doing, but a lot of people do do. And it it really really hurts them. And if you're falling into the traps of non-cross functional teams and not ready to fail fast and selling long-term exclusively and not fixing deliberately, then get out of those traps and get back on course. Third, and finally, remember why you got into product management. It's because you want to solve hard problems for real people. Now, the organizational stuff, that's just another hard problem to solve. And you're good at solving hard problems. Maybe your troubles are your opportunity. You know, in Friends, an outof work actor has a larger apartment than most millionaires. TV isn't reality. Books about best practice are equally not reality. Don't feel bad your flat is smaller than Joey's. And don't feel bad your company is less perfect than Marty's. And with that, Susanna, what's been going on in the chat? Not much yet, but I wanted to uh throw the floor open now to ask John any questions after that wonderful talk. Um feel free to just come off mute. Uh and if people are still thinking of a question, anyone any questions? I I've got one to start if if that helps Sean while other people are are pondering. >> Um so I'm from the uh COO GTM side uh and I have a long history of uh terrifying lots of product managers. How would you recommend that people um take that step across the divide uh and build those working relationships with their GTM colleagues to build these cross functional teams? So I guess it it really depends on what level you are in the or as you might expect. So if you're up at the top of the the and you're the CPO, you need to start getting into mapping how the investment where this much manday this much of bandwidth actually maps through to the revenue targets. And people would be remarkably reticent to do this. Um, you would think people would want to do it, but but generally sales marketing often don't want to do it because what they fear is they're going to have to factor in non-dely of new product and deliver the 40 million target and then if actually new product comes then have to do 45 million and they know that 40 million is too much of a stretch in the first place. They've no idea how they're going to get there and they don't want to get ratcheted up to 45. So at the very top of the org, you need to have some way where you're going to just align the CFO through to the CTO spend and live in the sort of adult world where there's lots and lots of uncertainty rather than saying I guarantee that this feature moving this button to here will add £50,000 and then these other things will add up. And I've seen companies demand that each one abs and CRO together and say look how are we going to do this? How are we going to do defend to the board that 20% of money is going in here and how are we going to know when to you know jack up the price to hit the revenue target because this product is unlikely to come to fruition on time. Okay, so that needs to get in place at at the top. Then down at the bottom, you sort of really want product marketing people involved very early like can you imagine selling this just write the two-pager now. It's never going to get better than how you're imagining at the very beginning of the project. So I find that getting people in for product marketing, which may be your product person acting like a product marketeer, maybe a marketeer acting like product marketing, you may be very lucky to have a dedicated area called product marketing. But I'd say that probably the easiest way when you're at the other end of the spectrum is sort of write the press release, see whether you can come up with the tangible statement of value. And terrifyingly, a lot of people can't do that. Like, you know, people have kind of become very solution oriented and are pushing it, but they're not able to come up with an actual uh statement of value that that would make a drop in in the market. >> Great. Thank you very much. the floor open to all of you guys now. Ah, right. I've got one from Vhan. Um, he says, "Thanks a lot from this very real talk. By the way, everybody else can also come off mute and and speak for themselves. I'm just going to read out Vhan's because he's popped it in chat. Uh, lots of insights for me, Sean. Can you talk about the most challenging problems that come to mind that you enjoyed solving and how you would do it differently now that you're on the other side of it?" >> Wow. I think the most challenging problems I didn't enjoy solving and at the time were absolute hell. Post merger integration was really really difficult. Um you know you you're taking two companies that prior to being integrated were very self-aware and knew that they needed to be so much better and all the conversations were about we're crap at this like let's try that let's get better at this. You know it was all about growth. It was all about um being unsatisfied with where we were and where we wanted to get to. And the second you go into a sort of adversarial merger situation, everyone defends how things are and they're selling the the the glory of the way that they currently do it. And that whole growth and let's stretch ourselves went out the window. That was really really difficult. And I had to at one point sort of say, look, I think this merger can work. You know, they and we are not the enemy. So, I stepped into the middle between the two orgs to try to bring them together. And I learned at that point in time, uh, everyone hates you because you're a traitor to one side and you're a wannabe to the other. And in fact, one of my nicest, uh, product managers, uh, we we had this funny internal internet. And she said, "I'm sorry there isn't a dislike button, John, but if there was, I would have clicked it on your article. You know, I I hate it. This this thing will never work. It should never have been done. You know, we should all give up." Um anyway, I stuck with it and it took a lot of just personal equity to convince people that other people were good, that they were well-intentioned, that they should be listened to, that you should assume good intent. Nothing to do with processes, nothing to do with all the classic things. It was just believe in other people, show empathy, and try and get closer. And that took a lot out of me personally. I was looking at photographs of myself from back then. my I I was I was a blotchy mess, you know. God, I was stressed beyond belief, but it paid off. H and that by when it did pay off, that felt amazing. Felt absolutely amazing because it was a real gamble. I I had no clue that it actually would work in the end. Um and the reason I stuck with it was because somebody when I went there, head hunter said, "You better stick around. You know, you move around too much." I am like I I do I I indulge myself but like stick with that. So I stuck with it and I'm very very pleased that I did. Um there are other things, you know, more micro like admitted were loads of interesting problems. I I dealt with everything that you see in the press. Um fraud, scans, extortion, really really really challenging and difficult things. and watching, you know, brilliant minds come together to solve things in ways that you, you know, no one person could could could do. Like it really did take a cross functional team. That that was magical. I I I I really enjoyed that. More questions. More questions. Did that answer your question? I mean, I think I think think you might have to take, you know, John out for a coffee to get all the war stories, but um any more for anymore? Okay, in that case, John, thank you so much. Oh, sorry, Marina. You just came off mute. >> Sure. I as I've been listening, um thanks, John. This was very uh interesting and um informative uh and as you know like sometimes I even I'm I'm starting to kind of struggle to figure out like what exactly are we as product managers um do right like you mentioned this whole kind of like the reality that um feature factory is almost it's not like inevit itable, right? Like you have to move fast. Uh especially early on as you're winning um you know customers. I'm working on a 0ero to1 product right now and um it's and it's a B2B product so it's hard not to um not to go into like trying to win uh to win those uh early and bigger uh customers. And um and part of me wonders, you know, like like how exactly like the product strategy fits into what we're doing, you know, it's it's hard it's hard to find like that kind of that piece that we're supposed to be bringing. >> Yeah. So, here's where I I so um I think this is where the the use of words and the way that product is used is is really annoying. Product I think at its best people are talking about the abstract product, not the org. And you know, to a certain maybe it should be the proposition. It's not just the abstract product. It's you know, how it's going to get actually presented in the market, the full thing. And so, you know, often times I'll go in and there'll be like product the org working on its bit, you know, what it thinks it needs to do, find love and do this and do that and not kind of fronting to the whole bigger thing and then feeling like it has to sort of offset the rest as opposed to just reconciling it all and say, "I need you to market it. I need you to sell it. I need you to be able to build it on time and I'm going to manage all of the trade-offs." If you view it that way, like you're not trying to counterbalance with, you know, your your missionary joy, counterbalance this evil business. If you say, "No, no, no. I just have to make it work. I've got to collect the gold rings, stay healthy, and not get eaten by the ghosts. I've got to, you know, pimp this thing to get that RFP. Then I got to pull back hard and actually spend stuff on stuff that that that's more extensible." I think it's much better when you own the whole thing and you own all those compromises rather than feeling that you're trying to resist those compromises or your job is to be I'll be here and someone else will reconcile it. Someone else doesn't come in and reconcile it. You know, I I I do feel like this is kind of like this slightly slightly uh what niggly framing of topic one. You know, I think too many people are sort of like, I'm here to bring long-term love and the rest of you are some sort of nasty compromise as opposed to um the ATM laughed at me yesterday when I asked for money. The investors don't believe in us anymore. Let's go out and make all the necessary tradeoffs to actually win in the market. Let's bring something great, but let's do it in the right order. Let's win the RFP. let's beef this up later. Let's accept that there's churn in that area. And and I don't see enough of that. So I think if you think if you accept that that's the job and you're doing all those tradeoffs, you feel a lot happier. If you think that you're on the sort of I've got to be the beacon of long-termness, then you'll be a lot less happy. Does that make sense? >> Yes, it does. Thanks, John. >> And I think like listening to people who are much bigger and better than me, they're like, "We want PMs to go back to being generalists. you know, because who the hell knows how things work? So, just is this worth paying for? Can we build it? You know what I mean? Will anyone want it? Um, just speak to some more fundamental questions and then and and cover that off and and do it at pace. And I think I think we'll all be much better off for that. Then the other thing talking a lot here but the other thing then is like our jobs are so different like we're all lumped into one thing in product but you know somebody is the PM for a deep technical API and someone else you know is a privacy risk manager in a giant government thing and someone else is doing a sort of sort of growth style job in a B in a B toc um company like the the roles are very very different and so I'm always loathed to sort of give generic advice. Um so if anyone is feeling like look that doesn't resonate with me, it's perfectly possible that you know there is quite little commonality across many of these roles. More questions. Come on. My ego needs you to ask me questions. I'll feel like we haven't succeeded if people just drive off. So, I'm I'm going to throw myself out there, ask more questions, and worst case scenario, we'll just have to ask people. Do we have anyone to step forward? Any more for anymore? No one wants to help out John's ego. >> Helen first. You give to get the last word. >> I don't have any questions. I would I would just say that um what resonated for me was the uh the mergers piece. Um I'm I'm product manager in for a business that was acquired by a larger business. So we're very much in that uh integration stage while also trying to um grow and evolve. So that that definitely resonated for me that that is that is the challenge of balancing all those things and the ego side of things of a are they right with the way they do it? They've done all this testing. They've you know validated stuff with data. Maybe we haven't but we've still seen successes. So um >> you know it was it's just very very interesting. So yeah, um >> I I I remember working with a CEO once and I had to explain to him, you know, you treat your children like foster children and biological children, you know, like everyone knows who's the foster children, his biological children. They all know to expect different sizes of presence and they're going to be get talked about differently. You've got to put a huge amount of effort in to not do that. You got to stop saying them and us. You've got to make sure that the IT department means you don't have to dial 9ine to call one colleague and dial zero to dial another. That the email alias doesn't remain different, you know, and you got to work on yourself a lot because no matter how much you actually believe it abstractly, there's lots of micro behaviors you you you've got to beat out of yourself. >> Absolutely. You've got to find an alternative way to refer to it because it's still something you need to refer to while you are still integrating. So if you if you're told you can't use one set of terminology for something anymore, you need to be given an alternative while they are still tangibly different. >> Yeah. Yeah. I think you know managing that defensive gene as well. I I I've definitely at times you know you you get the feedback and you you've got a very strong instinct to defend and in an emergency situation that that becomes very very difficult you know. >> Cool. Well, my ego has now been satiated, so we don't need to have any more questions. But if anyone does have any questions, and we can we can cut something, we can cut the recording at any point. So, somebody just doesn't fancy being immortalized on YouTube, you put their question. We can we can agree from here on in, you know, you're you're okay. It's just us. It's just us chickens. >> Well, well, John, if >> there we go. And you I can see you on the edge. Yeah, I can see you just on the edge. >> Uh I'm afraid not another question at this point, but it's it's just really interesting to learn from your experience. Um especially with the maturity that you've you've of course uh I've had to develop across so many companies that you work for. Um uh I was uh I was at uh research gate not too long ago for a product tank event. >> Very cool. Um uh and they did talk about how uh well one of the product managers over there was a uh he's an acquaintance and he did talk about how he was unhappy with the the the product culture over there. So what you just talked about was quite relatable. Uh I deal with a similar situation in my world. I I work in public sector um where the rest of the or is is very much waterfall because you know they're not non techch nonprofit. Um, and I just put a comment in the in the message box as well. Um, so I write I I work for a non non-product orientated company where other non- tech verticals work very waterfall way. So finding that that rhythm and and being able to communicate with people getting them along uh has been a real challenge. Um >> yeah, you know what I find very difficult as well is I I remember I was in was in a VC back company and the VC would get all the different CPOS together to share best practice and people would say you know and I do this you know I am perfection squared and I do this and I remember calling one of them up directly after said do you really do that you know like like you know tell me straight well we don't do it yet but we're planning on doing it. I was like, well, the difference between that is me leaving this forum thinking I'm uniquely behind and, you know, this person who hadn't done it a few months ago has gone through it and sailed through it, whereas I I've started to do it. It's quite difficult. People are, you know, I I was chatting to Claude and and Gemini about this chat and they were like, you know, uh it's good to counter toxic positivity, you know, where where everything is just look at what amazing things I've done. So um you know do not feel too bad about wherever your your your or is at and you can feel probably better about yourself if you do move them on a little bit than yeah >> you know joining somewhere where where really it's sort of handed to you on a place >> here. Thank you all for coming. Really appreciate it. Thank you for letting me do this. Um hosture is fabulous by the way. So, if I know I don't you probably all know this, but um I did the AI course to sort of get get your hands dirty and build stuff. Amazing fun. Uh and actually very useful too. So, um I should sort of add this on as a unpaid for mini advert at the end. Um cool. Thank you very much. I shall sign. >> Thank you, John. That was wonderful. >> Thank you all. >> Thank you. Thank you, John. Bye. Bye.
