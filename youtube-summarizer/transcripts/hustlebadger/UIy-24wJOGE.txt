So, hey everyone. I'm Ed Biden. I'm one of the co-founders of Hustlebadger. And um today I'm going to give you a little bit of an intro to AI prototyping where I basically just show you one of the tools and I build something live. Um now this is going to be a very kind of unpolished session by design. So I'm going to be building a weather app in Lovable. Um, I'm going to go quite slowly, partly so that you can follow along. Um, if you want to, um, partly because, um, I flew in from the US this morning on a redeye and so I'm not at my quite my sharpest self. But this is also a little bit by design. I'm kind of hoping some things go slightly wrong so you can see my debugging process, but not so wrong that they derail the whole uh, demonstration. So, we'll see how that works out. Um it's also you know a live session if you are here now uh coming through the luma link. Um so please do ask me questions make suggestions um I want this to be sort of as useful for you as as possible. If you're watching this on our YouTube channel later you probably want to watch this at about you know one and a half speed or two 2x speed or something um to get the so that it's a bit a bit more interesting. Before we kick off, I am just going to drop a few links into um into the chat and I'll try and keep one eye on the chat as I I um sort of like work through things. So um if you want to connect with me on LinkedIn, I talk about you know AI prototyping and AI tooling quite a bit. Um the recording for this session is going to be on our YouTube channel where all our recordings are. So do subscribe to that if you haven't already. Um, if you want to register for other Hustlebget talks, webinars, then check out our Luma page. And if this is kind of interesting and you want to go deeper, then do check out our um build with AI course. We have a cohort kicking off next week and we cover not just AI prototyping, but also sort of AI coding. So using cursor or anti-gravity claw code those kinds of tools as well as building um agents and agentic workflows in relay.app. So um with that let me get going. And actually just before I really dive into lovable a little bit about sort of my journey um with these tools. I've been building things with these tools for um about 9 months now and um I'm going to stop sharing this cuz I'm going to show you just some of the other things that I've built. So I've I've I've been using initially I was using Replet. I've been trying out uh V0 Figma make um I'm now using I I went through a cursor phase. I'm now using anti-gravity a lot. So I've played around with a lot of the tools and happy to kind of answer um questions on that as well. But one of the things um that I found is like you know as soon as you start using these AI prototyping tools you get so much more confident with how products are built and how code looks overall that actually making this step up to a full IDE like cursor or anti-gravity it becomes much less intimidating. Um, and so, um, that's actually I I now go almost always just like straight into an an IDE. But let's have a little look at, um, let's have a look at mood movie. So, I'm hoping you can see this. Can you see movie genre explorer? Yeah, great. So, this was one of the very first things that I I kind of coded. I actually did this in replet and and it's just a simple um, you know, well, movie recommendation engine. This took about two or three hours. Um, so you can see you can pick your genre, you can pick the era. This is all kind of like relative to my uh my age uh basically. And then you see you get some movies here recommended. And these all have I think at least 70 or 80% on IMDb. You can see that there. And then if you kind of want to watch the trailers, those just kind of pop up straight away, which is quite nice. And you and you can watch them. So something like this, um, you know, you can easily build in in an evening. and and most of the time that I spent building this was actually getting the styling right and kind of like getting these nice gradients and things again when I one of the first things I I I did since then I've gone into some more kind of functional stuff. So I've been building things like um this API explorer. So if you want to check out a uh let me just reload this. You if you want to check out like an API like this this Google one, you can see um what you get back from it. We're going to be using an API today. So you'll see that might be quite quite useful. Um and a couple of things or maybe just one thing I was building over the um over Christmas. I decided to build this this kind of showcase for vibe coded projects which I haven't really shared with anyone else yet but so it's only got my projects in but you can see some of these things I've been building in you know quite nice. I think this this was like again one evening. Um but uh you know has Google login and you know you or email login and people can submit their projects and um when you click through to them you can you can see kind of how they built it and and all this sort of stuff and what they built it in. So again just to give you like a few different things that that I've been um building building recently. Anyway, what we're going to do tonight, as I say, is build something in Lovable. And I thought we'd just build like a very simple weather app. Um, I'm going to show you kind of almost like the easiest thing you can do. And then I'm going to kind of start kind of developing that a little bit more. Um, because I say if you have questions, suggestions, please jump in the chat and we'll kind of like do those as we go along. So yeah, at its simplest like lovable um you you know if you create an account and I've just got the free version at the moment. Well hopefully that'll be enough for for this evening. We can just kind of like go into we'll get this little prompting page uh prompt box here and we could just ask it to build something. Now, usually I um if I am on my own um which, you know, I know you're all here, but I mean I'm not I don't I'm not in a shared office. Um I will be using voice. So, I'll probably just chat to it and ask it to build me a weather app, see what it does, and then based on that, we'll kind of rebuild it with a bit of a better better prompt and a bit of a more detailed spec. Can you build me a simple weather app that shows me what the weather is like in Echim in London? So, um, so you can see that's just kind of really really easy. Don't need to think about it. It may ask me some questions here. Some of them, some of the AI prototyping tools will ask you kind of clarification questions or they will do a little plan before they build. Um, this is going to So here it's it's coming up with was it assigned, right? This is what it's going to build. Features weather condition icon. Great. And it's off, right? So it hasn't asked me for any approval here. Um, it's just it's just getting going fine. Um, while it's doing that, you know, I've mentioned some of the tools there. Uh, and you know, a few people have posted in the chat what they're using. I'm using Lovable just because that seems to sort of be one of the more popular tools or one of the more like known tools at the moment, but really you can use any tool. Um, Replet, Figma, Make, V0, Bolt, and there are a bunch of others. Um, they all work fairly similarly, like they they have almost always, you know, very similar feature parity for for the most part. um and very similar UI as well. So there aren't at the moment huge barriers to choosing different thing uh different different uh tools and actually switching between tools is really easy as well. Okay, so you can see how long was that? You know, maybe maybe a minute or two and we've already got a little a little weather thing here. Um which is great. So what can we see here? It's got the weather. Um, partly cloudy, seems right. Uh, feels like one degrees. Feels about right. It's pretty cold right now. Humidity, wind. I mean, this doesn't doesn't look ridiculous. Um, and it says it's getting the weather from from open uh Meteor, which is um it's a free weather API as well, even though I didn't tell it what to do. We can check that. Actually, why don't we just have a quick look at like weather in Beckham today? Okay. So, can you I'm assuming you can see my Google screen now. Yeah. Can you see? Yeah. Great. So, yeah, we can see it's 6°. Um, here it's saying humidity is 79% and wind speed is 9 uh 9 miles hour. So, 9 miles per hour, 15 km/h. That feels about right. Okay, great. So, we've got something. It's not very exciting. Um, but we gave it a very a very simple prompt. So, if you want to build something I that is like the kind of as bare bones as you can get and you know weather app as well as sort of like something very um uh you basic or kind of like classic kind of hello world just get going um type of project. But let's mix it up a bit. Usually if I'm building something um I won't type out a prompt like this um because what you want is generally like a more detailed prompt more more kind of uh requirements in there so that what you get is closer to or what lovable builds is actually closer to what you want rather than just sort of the the average of what you know the internet might think of as a a weather app. you know that's yeah essentially there's there's a bunch of LLMs behind um Lovable or any of these tools that are building the code here right so if you don't give them any instructions they will just default to sort of what they've been trained on which is the entire internet so you will get kind of very plain vanilla beige type of app context you give them the more details then the more it's going to be personalized to you so let's create a new chat here And again, I'm going into chat GPC. You could do this in Gemini. You could do this in Claude, wherever you want to. And I'm just again, I'm going to use the um dictation mode. Um but what I'm going to use here is just like a a kind of combination of prompts and techniques that help me get a spec then um drop into into lovable uh very fast. So, let's go for it. So, I want to build a weather app and I uh in in an AI prototyping tool and I want you to help me uh write the spec for it. So, I'm going to give you the basic idea for it, but then I want you to um ask me any clarifying questions until we've got enough information for you to write up a kind of simple, not too fancy prompt that I can copy paste into lovable. Um, does that make sense? Just say yes or no. And if yes, I'll I'll give you a couple more requirements before you start asking me questions. Great. So, it's understood that. Oh, the other thing I forgot to mention is strictly only ask me one question at a time. I don't want you printing out like 30 questions for me to ask all at once. Anyway, okay. So, this weather app, um, I want it to be for where I am at the moment, which is in Pekkham in London. And this the problem I have with most weather apps is that I don't know what the weather is compared to yesterday. Um, so I want to show the weather today versus the weather yesterday. And then I'll have the kind of relative difference. Is it warmer or colder than yesterday? Which will help me understand what I should wear. The other thing is um you know 15° 8 degrees like what does that mean? Should I wear a coat? Should I wear thick socks or thin socks? Should I wear a hat? Do I need sunscreen? What I want you to do as well as showing me the actual numbers, I want you to translate that into a um kind of useful, practical, not too detailed, just kind of like but sensible guide on what I should wear. You know, do I need a coat? Do I need an umbrella? Do I need sunscreen? that kind of thing. Um, yeah, that's the basic idea. So, yeah, got any questions? Then ask me those and we'll clarify them before we write up the spec. So, I can just do this in voice and you can see I can be quite chatty. Oh, no. Chat GPT has somehow failed to capture this or has it? What's going on? Well, I did say I wanted things to go wrong. So, you know, there we go. It's just like not not got any of that, right? We'll try that again. Um, despite the fact I I've had this problem with chat GPT a few times, actually. I don't know if any of you have, uh, where it won't record stuff, but even so, I I still generally find it better to use voice. Only ask me strictly one question at a time. this weather app. I want to get the weather yesterday as well as the weather today so that I can compare between the two. And I also want you to convert today's weather into a kind of practical but simple guide of what to wear. Do I need a hat? Do I need a coat? Umbrella, sunscreen, that sort of thing. Um, okay. Ask me any questions. If you do have to repeat yourself, you generally get to the point much faster, which is the benefit. Okay. Location model, right? Yeah, I forgot to mention that. And and here, you know, if you do this, you you I kind of always recommend this on the on the kind of some of the courses I teach. Um, someone came back and was like, "Yeah, I spent two hours like answering questions." I was like, "Whoa, you don't have to answer every single question that Chad GPT has because Chad GPT will just keep asking you questions. just answer like three or four and then and then kind of tell it that you've you've done enough. Um let's just make it kind of hardcoded. I'm in Pekkham, London. So, uh people don't need to be able to change the the date. This is just for me. Uh I just want this to run in a browser. So, it' be great if it's kind of responsive. So, it works on both uh mobile and web. Uh, and you can also you you can usually tell kind of when it's not worth writing and or like responding to questions because the questions get a bit uh boring. How literal should the what to wear guidance be? A fixed checklist. No, no, no, no. Okay. Um, let's have a short plain English advice like you know your mom might give you if you are going out like oh you better take a coat love that sort of thing. By the way if anyone here has suggestions of how they want this web uh this weather app to turn out please do stick them in the chat and I will be happy to build um a few of them in. Now, this is quite interesting because if you're not technical, then you probably don't have any idea about like APIs or anything like this. And the great thing about talking over your specs with Chat GPT is you don't need to know the answers to these things. You can just kind of flip this back um to to Chat GPT. Uh I don't really know anything about weather APIs, so I just want one that is free and has good quality data. uh maybe you can recommend one. So what I do a lot of the time is you know if it's a technical requirement then I will kind of ping it back to chat dpt. If it's a kind of user requirement which I've got a feeling for then I'll I'll give it an answer. Which of these do you prefer? I don't know. I mean I I literally know nothing about weather APIs. So you pick one. Don't let chat GPT believe you into giving it you answers. Okay, it's going to use open weather. I do actually know a bit about weather APIs now that because I've done this a few times, but um let's see next question. For yesterday's weather, do you want summary data only? Average temperature yet or hourby hour breakdown? No. Uh I just want summary data. I just want to know like snapshot yesterday versus today, you know, is it going to be warm or colder? that that that sort of thing. Um I don't need an hour by hour breakdown. In fact, I might just kind of um two more questions, Max. Let's not spend the whole time answering questions. Do you want the comparison to be explicitly stated in words? Today is colder than yesterday. Uh let's Yeah. So, no, no, no. Just I've changed my mind. I've changed my mind. I just want to see them side by side. I just want to see them side by side. The good thing about this as well is you you you've got kind of a vague idea, then you will actually kind of force yourself to get it much clearer in your mind when you do this historical reference. And so, sorry, I'm just looking at the chat here. Derek would like to see a historical reference in simplified terms. something like, "Oh, Derek, I just answered that question. I'll change my mind. I'll follow your lead. Change my mind." Last question. Do you want the tone of the app itself to be neutral or do you want the whole app to use that warm, slightly cheeky voice? Let's go for the warm, slightly cheeky voice. Warm, slightly cheeky tone of voice. Okay. So um do we need to be conscious of so another question here in the app do we need to be conscious about the text app for the web app no like anything technical like that you you don't really need to care about okay copy paste lovable prompt so you can just do this um you know you could just kind of copy this and paste it in I quite often like asking chatty to put it into markdown uh uh because it then just comes out as a code block which you can copy paste um really easily. So here you see I don't have to worry about formatting and whether that's going to kind of translate into the lovable prompt box or not. Um so uh and I also can just copy this bit here. So right let's go back to lovable. I feel like we haven't loable right. Um let's rebuild this uh with the following prompt. Okay. So, and you can see I've just pasted all of that stuff straight in and we'll go for it. Now, this because this is a much longer prompt, this is probably going to take a little bit longer than the initial app. So, whilst that took like a um you know like a minute to generate this I wouldn't be surprised if it takes um you know three four maybe even five minutes um to come up with something. But let let's see what it does. It has it's already got kind of a a basic here. Okay. So, here it's saying again it's talking about APIs. It wants to use the open met meio API rather than the open weather one. Yeah. And in fact, it's not even asking me for approval. it's just going to use the the the API. I think in the last month or 6 weeks um you know the LLMs are always changing but they have become a little bit more opinionated and so rather than always asking you like oh but is it okay if I use this other API? You can see here was just being like yeah you asked this API but actually I I disagree so I'm going to go with this one. So it's got more of an opinion which is usually good. Um but if you do have a particular reason for um wanting to use a particular API, you know that you haven't told it, you you can just stop it, right, and and correct it and and you shouldn't be afraid to do that. Um so Aiden's asking, do you feel if there's any value in using different AI tools to review your prompt? E generate the prompt in chat GPT and get Claude to review. Um, so I usually wouldn't get another LLM to review a prompt. I if I wasn't doing this live, I would have read through this my myself and kind of just fine-tuned the the prompt myself to make sure it's um looking good. If I've actually got the code there, I will occasionally use different LLMs or different tools to review each other, but generally only if they get stuck. So, um, you know, if Lovable is kind of running into a a loop of bugs where it's just having real problems showing something, then I might copy some bits of the code or just take a screenshot of the errors I'm seeing, drop that into, you know, Chad GPT Gemini and and say, "Hey, can you help me debug this?" And that that that's really kind of um helpful. Like you again these days, you don't even need to copy the code really or the the errors you're getting. a a screenshot is going to tell them um everything that they need to know. And I've seen chat GPC kind of spot you literally like typos in API requests um and correct it and explain it to me like what what's going on. So, you see, I've kind of learned a little bit about APIs over the last few months from building things like this, but getting this far, you don't really need to know anything about APIs to to build stuff that's using APIs, using real data. Um, uh, and and and it's coming up, you know, with with with proper data here. Okay. So, that was pretty quick. So what we can see yesterday versus today historical comparison pretty for this time of year actually. Yeah. Great. Uh M style clothing advice. It's chilling wet blowing gale. Take your waterproof and maybe an extra layer. You'll thank me later. Ah that's quite a nice friendly error messages. Right. Okay. So just checking out the biggest blocker I find using these tools is giving them database access uploading data. The use case I'm building for prototyping at the moment is an app that requires lots of data in the form of tables. Yeah. Can we speak a bit more? I was going to say if if so we've got our basic app here and I think we might do like a few things. Um so firstly what we could do is um think about yeah connecting this to to say superbase. So why don't we do that? And and something that we might do for this is say so superbase. Yeah, if you want to store any data persistently in your app um that you're building, you're going to need a database. You need to store that data some somewhere. Um for a lot of these uh prototyping tools, Superbase is kind of like the default go-to kind of database off a shelf that you can set up. And so you could use that for user records um or you could use that for um any other data that you're you're storing. So some of those other apps that I showed you um like my my vibe coded showcase like that uses superbase to store all the different projects, all the different users. But this one we sort of, you know, get it to set up a superbase uh database by um having a user login and then having a um you getting it to save on person by person basis which which locations they wanted. So why don't we set that up and we'll do that in we can just do that in the chat. This looks great. Now can you add a database in superbase? Um, what I want to happen is, yeah, users can sign up with an email and a password. And then the first time they sign up, we ask them what their location is, and that should be a postcode or address lookup. Um, and then we should save that between sessions so that when they log in, they see the weather for uh where they are. Okay. So this should then it might ask me to upgrade so that we can um use uh lovable cloud. So yeah to show you a few more features on on lovable and and again like most of the AI tools have these different kind of features in one way or another. Um it's asking for Lovable Cloud to add authentication and database storage, right? So yeah, I'm going to allow that. At the top here, you're going to see a few different things. Um, the main window here, you can see is a preview of what we're building. Um, but actually, we can look at the code here. Um, that's probably the first one I would go to. And you can see all the different files that that uh Lovable's written then to build our our app. And you can go in and you can edit these yourself if you if you really want to. Um, it's been asking to got a little bonus. Should I claim my I will claim my five credits. Great. Yes, free credits. Thank you, Lovable. Um, so, uh, cloud is is up here. Cloud has a whole bunch of things. They've added this quite recently where you can have a database. You can have storageages for will be for kind of like, you know, images, videos, audio files, kind of like any kind of like media things that you want there. Um you'll then have it looks like oh yeah the AI stuff here lets you kind of add in LLM calls LLM API calls to your um apps fairly easily. You've got logs if you're debugging which you don't need to worry about. I think users will be authentication so you can see who's who's um signing up here. Is this still going? Lovable clouds enabled. Now I'll create database schema and then implement authentication. Uh I think it's just waiting for me to put that aloud. So yeah, so this this is basically a um a database query. You can see it's it's SQL basically. Um but running this is um going to set up the database for me. So generally if you see a blue button you can click on it and it will sort it out. Um right database is set up. Has it set it up in now? I'll create the components and the pages. Now, interestingly, I wonder where it's actually created that database and if it's created in Superbase or not because it hasn't asked me for any Superbase setups, has it? No, I don't think so. And there's nothing here. I wonder where it's put that then. Well, I'll wait for it to start stop editing and then we can investigate a little bit further. Once it's created this, the other thing I will do is I will um I'll publish it so you can all get personalized and uh mom friendly advice on the weather um as well, but I'll also just push it to GitHub. So, if you did want to, you know, both show you how that that works, but also if you want to download it yourself, um you could do that. Right. So, it's editing all the all the stuff here. Um, superbase. Um, if you are going to play around with it, I'll just show I'll show you. Um, it's a little bit I mean, no, it's a lot more technical than lovable. Um, you generally don't really need to go into it that much. So, I'm already signed up. You'll see I've got a few different projects here. Um, again, so this is the the vibe, you know, viooding showcase one. So, you you can see, you know, like it will show you the tables that you've got in your database. It will show you all the things that you've got. Um, so these are the different projects that I saw, you know, that you saw um there and it's got some of these, you know, you can see all the the data entries. So, it's really kind of useful for um storing databases and it does it does have a free tier and and and all that sort of stuff if you want to do authentication. It helps you set up all of that stuff. So, you can see here I've got I've got Google login for that one. Um, and you can see, yeah, it's got my email address. It tells me how I've I've logged up. That said, getting this set up, you know, you're going to have API keys that you you're going to have to store environment variables. Chat, GPT, Gemini will talk you through how to do this. Um, and as with anything else, like, you know, if you get to the stage where um, lovable or chat is saying like, "Hey, maybe you should set up a a superbase um database." Firstly, I'd sort of like challenge it and say like, "Okay, just talk me through why we need to do that, you know, so that you understand what it's doing." Then once you're happy that's the right decision, just ask it to talk you through the the steps and, you know, and follow them. Um, you will just learn so much by doing that as well as you'll get to the outcome that you want to. Um I've yet to find a technical concept that I could not understand or something that I could not do myself um just by following that approach of just asking uh an NLM to talk me through it. Um Derek's asking how do you deal with issues using private API keys for published web apps? How do you prevent the keys from showing the source code? Yeah, so this is a really good question and again like things are moving so quickly that six months ago this was like the big scare thing people being like oh but my API keys will be exposed and you know these vibe coders on X are getting you know people seeing their API keys and now it's just not not a big deal. So, if we go back to lovable, um, we'll check out what it's done in just a moment. But if I had, uh, you API keys, those would go in in a cloud here. I mean, you see the secrets, right? I could store um, API keys here. You know, I put in the secret name, I put in the value, and I add as many as I want. Um, when they are stored here, you know, I'm not pasting them in the chat. I'm not writing them into the codebase. when they are stored here, they are secure. So these are environment variables. Um and anywhere that you are you if you're building something in cursor anti-gravity and you're then deploying it through something like VersaL or Netlefi, they will have the same thing like where do you put your environment variables? So you just need to figure out sort of like where do these where do these tools store environment variables and again you can just ask them where do I store my API credentials securely and how do I do that and they will point you in the right direction. Okay, let's see what it's built. Um, the app now has authentication, location setup, persistent location, and let's just check the database. And I still not see anything. Okay, where is the database? Is it So, one thing you can do if you're just asking a question and you don't want to burn credits, then you can see this little chat button. You can actually see I'm hoping you can see the uh the tool tip there. You chat without making edits to your project. So you can ask questions of lovable and of the the code base um without it kind of then going and editing things. So I'm just going to ask it if it's in superbase or in lovable because we did ask it to make it in lovable but maybe it maybe it didn't. Let's sign up. uh edit hustlebadger.com by giving it a very basic password. It's part of lovable cloud. Okay. I was hoping to show you superbase setup. Lovables overruled me and just built it in its own default database. I we we could we could kind of go back and be like, "No, no, no, do this in in Superbase, but maybe that's I think that would probably like take another 20 minutes or so. It might not be worth it." Uh, right now, can you explicitly ask the AI to harden the security on the app, check against OWAS top 10, and get the desired result? What? I don't know. I don't know what OAS top 10 is, uh, Andy, but let's find out. Um, Let's see what happens. >> So, I mean, remember again, because you've you've got an LLM behind all of these tools, you can ask them quite general questions and they will give you an answer. Um, the thing you want to make sure is, you know, you you're just in the right mode. um they generally have a kind of coding mode and a chat mode. So coding mode will go and build a website um for you. Chat mode will kind of answer questions. So it's almost a bit like the difference between you know a thinking or a deep thinking model in chat GPT versus a kind of like fast response model. Um if you want to change the website obviously put it into that thinking mode that's the default mode and go and build the website. But if you're just asking little questions about things um don't burn your credits. stick it into chat mode and go from there. So, right, so it's doing a uh you know a security analysis here and you can see all the things it's doing and I think even some of these tools now do have kind of security so the kind of built-in security scans where they will kind of go and do different things. So here you can see it it's up to date right. So this is it's just run it uh this is what it's been doing here. What's working well? Post code API call property uses this to prevent injection. Authentication state is managed. Oh that's interesting. So it's saying that the authentication state is managed via superbase, not via local storage. And I think actually a lot of this actually I've seen this before with lovable is sometimes it will kind of give you slightly conflicting responses about where things are happening. Is it happening kind of in lovable cloud or in Superbase? And I think that's effectively because Superbase is powering a lot of this lovable cloud stuff. So I don't think it's it's lying to you so much as the parts of the code will say this is in superbase because it is but some of it will say like no no no it's in lovable because it's kind of almost got this lovable uh layer on on the front of it. So yeah you you could then follow these enable leaked password protection configure the authentication system to check passwords against known breach password databases. So, we could do this. Um, it's just giving us a plan there. Let's see. Maybe we can go through. Oh, there's a button. Implement that plan. Great. What happens if we implement that plan? It'll probably go through and do it. Um, so we can Yeah. Yeah. You can generally what I found is any problem that you kind of pops up you can ask an LLM either in one of these tools or again like a general LLM you're kind of like Claude TPT like I'm seeing this problem how do I fix it? Um or if you're anticipating problems saying like hey I need really high security on this before I see this problem like what problems might I see? How do I protect against that? How do I can you can you stress test this for me? it will kind of tell you what are the main things you should think about and then you can ask it about okay well what is the solution there so I was building an app where I wanted users to input their own LLM API keys so that they could test uh LLM prompts I didn't want them using my API keys and obviously like those API keys need to be stored securely so actually as soon as I started talking API keys and being able to put those in chat GBT kind of picked up that needed to be storing those securely and and I could tell from just the way it was writing the spec and then the way that I was building this in anti-gravity that anti-gravity was then responding it was kind of doing things sensibly and you know much as you would chat to a developer right you you kind of even if you're non technical you kind of gauge whether the requirements are being met not because you understand on a technical level what it's doing but because it's you know the developer the LLM is kind of talking in a way that convinces you that this is it's thought about all the problems. Um, and if it seems to be a bit off or it seems to miss the point, then you ask further follow-up questions and you double check and you maybe even run some tests, right? Okay. So, it says it's done all these things. UK host code validation, stronger passwords. It would probably fail my my my password now. Um, let's let's publish this. Um, and then we'll see if there's weather app is not going to exist. Weather maybe hustle badger weather. There we go. Who can visit this? Yeah, anyone. Great. Let's do it. Oh, I'm still seeing a warning. This may now be this. Hopefully this this leaked password disabled should be fixed if I from from this work that I just did. So, we've got a few more questions in the in the chat. Let me just get back to those. Is this publishing? Oh, it's still it's got to do with a security scan before it publishes. Right. Do you have any thoughts on the quality of code that is generated by lovable? I'm not a dev, but feedback push back I tend to get is that the code could be difficult to build on top of an app which is being AI vibecoded. Uh so I I think I do think there is a difference between you know working on a legacy product with these tools um and shipping code versus building something from scratch. you know a a kind of existing product will just have a generally a much bigger um code base that is then you know difficult to understand for the LLMs you want the code in kind of good order for you know humans to build on in the future and you're going to need a slightly more nuanced approach if you're building something from scratch though or if you're prototyping something which is you know throwaway code you're then going to ask some developers to you human developers to build it for you for real, then I I just don't care about the code quality because I care about whether it works or not and I'm not looking at the code. And you're even seeing you know we saw the the founder of uh Claude code saying that you know he is like stopping like writing code himself even for writing code for claude code. You know Claude code is now writing its own code. Um and so I think the kind of this issue of code quality is going to become less of a thing. Um, yes, of course, you know, you're going to get some engineers who are very particular about the way that they build things and what it looks like, but increasingly you're just going to get a lot of people being like, "Yeah, but does does it work? Like, does it ship?" Like, and that is the only test that really matters. Um, Sarah's then asking, "If you wanted to integrate it with something like Runner, EG shows you that the weather might be too challenging for your program, could you do that?" Um, yes, if Runner has an API. Um so uh as soon as you start coding these things like you getting familiar with APIs is one of the most powerful things you can do because you can integrate with all these different services and you know get real data from things like you know weather API you can integrate with you know superbase or Google login or whatever it is or other you know straa runner uh whatever it is that you want to as well and the limitation is just like do they have an API and what information can you get out of that API and that is something that yeah LLMs are very very good at doing um because APIs generally have documentation and LLM's love reading documentation and summarizing it um so happy days for everyone don't read the documentation yourself askp is there an API what can it do um and just ask a few kind of follow-up questions as well I didn't realize that this security scan took so But there we go. It's still running. Oh. So, it looks like it has not fixed this thing. There's a few things here. This I thought it said it was going to fix. Seems to have just ignored the issue. Anyway, I do want to come back and see if this would if we could publish this. No changes to publish. Oh, is this already live? I completely missed that. Well, there you go. I thought we had to uh run the security check. But there you go. If you want to check out my lovely app, you now can. You should all be able to sign up. Um let me know if you have any problems. So I I um we could of course kind of go and do all sorts of things here. You know, we could check how this uh security um uh passes done and and try and kind of fix some of those um some of those issues there. Um we could add new features. We could, you know, I said I was going to push it to to actually let's see if we can just quickly push it to um GitHub if we want to. Where are we? pushing this to GitHub is I mean I've already signed up to GitHub. Um so it's very very simple. So connect to GitHub. Uh connect project. There we go. I'm going to use this one. Yes, great. I'm going to transfer it anyway. So yeah, I mean GitHub repository is now there. And if we go to GitHub, let's go to Do we have There we go. There. There it is. So, there's my Hustlebger weather um codebase. I mean, again, if you're not technical, you probably don't care um that you've now got your code in in GitHub. Um, but this is quite useful if yeah, if I did want to pull this into a different tool or I wanted someone else to be able to use this this code. Um, this is private. Can I make this public? I might not mess around. You can rebuild this so quickly it's probably not even worth making it um public. So, yeah. Um, you can do all that that sort of stuff. Um, Elia is saying like, you know, is this recording going to be available? Yes. And let me drop those links, um, quickly back into the chat. So, um, the recording for this will be on our YouTube. Um, again, we we're going to have, uh, probably more talks like this, uh, on our Luma. Um, and if you did want to go deeper on this topic, then you can check out our build with AI cohort as well. As I mentioned at the start, it kind of we spend time going deeper into the techniques that I've kind of shown today. Um, we also go into, you know, how to use cursor anti-gravity, some of the kind of idees, kind of slight more powerful tools. Um, as well as how to kind of build agents and things. Anyway, I'd be really interested to get your feedback on this session. um be I'd be happy to do more sessions like this in the future and if people wanted to look at slightly different um you know skills or techniques like going deeper into setting up a database or you know setting up Stripe or or something like that. I'd be super happy to kind of talk through those and showcase those as well. Um so yeah do let me know. Drop me a message on LinkedIn or um drop me a quick email. Um,
