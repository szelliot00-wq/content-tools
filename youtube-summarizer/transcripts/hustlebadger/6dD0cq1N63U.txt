We're super lucky to have Dave here to chat to us um about how product leaders drive AI adoption at their companies. But before we get into that, just a few housekeeping points. Um please do stay on mute just while Dave is speaking. Um and if you have questions, stick them in the chats and then he can pick them up sort of whether it's a a good kind of point in his flow. Uh and we don't have too much background noise. Um secondly, we are recording this uh this this whole call. So if you have to leave early um then uh it'll be on our YouTube channel in well by by tomorrow I'm going to drop a few links in the chat. So I will drop um link to our Luma where you can register for future events, link to YouTube where you'll get Dave's recording uh after this and I'll also be sharing uh Dave's LinkedIn um URL if you want to connect with him uh because I know he posts a lot about this and he has his own podcast and does lots of wonderful things as well. With that, I'll get out the way. Dave, over to you. >> Okay, so where do I go? I mean, there's a lot of stuff on my podcast I put out there in terms of ways of dancing with AI more effectively. I'll recap them. And what I'd like to do is actually dive into something which I've not yet released um which has blown my socks off over the last maybe three, four weeks. I'm recording a podcast on that today so you get early access to it. Um just to kind of recap um so back in when was it? February of last year it was product London and uh I saw some people in the chat have seen that s session and I was asked to go and present to people on AI to product geeks on AI and I thought well surely like really like surely [clears throat] everyone understands what what's possible right so I felt like a bit of a bit of an id going on stage quite frankly thinking like everyone's going to know this stuff already and the reaction was bonkers people like their jaw were on the floor because no one really has time unfortunately in the world that we live in as product geeks to play with where the puck's going, right? Um, and so it was a real honor and since then I've been giving this version of this talk to lots of different enterprise companies that want me in to wake up their exec and and the wider or to the possibilities. Um but it's been yeah a quite crazy a crazy time over the last year kind of showing this presentation to people and I've even given the presentation uh and to oh was which one was it? Um Munich uh the product festival in Munich and that one um was not that dissimilar to the one we gave in February of last year and still Jaws were on the floor. [laughter] I even said to people at the end like guys like if you think you've just caught up with what's possible with AI right now like that this the bulk of what's in here is like nearly a year old and they're like huh anyway just to recap what my my my kind of take of the key pillars of what's in that presentation for you and if you haven't seen it it is on YouTube the first thing is the importance of speech to text I've been talking about this to anyone that will listen to me for the last two and a half years only recently has um Reed Hoffman been saying he's been voice pill um because It's just the most effective thing to get more time back in our day, right? The problem is we're so busy, we haven't got the time to figure out how to bl play play and dance with AI. But if you just do this first thing of downloading flowvoice.ai or superwisper.com and playing and and using voice to to guide your your AI, it's just so effective. We type at the best of us 75 words a minute. And me as an Irishman, depending on how enthusiastic I am about the topic at hand, can be 220. Miraculously, the AI understands me. So, I would say the first thing you all need to do if you're not doing it at all yet is please lean in to voice. Get comfortable with it. My husband doesn't like doing it. He's very British. And I'm like, look, just say I love you. Say thank you. And I'm convinced psychologically that shifts your relationship to become an awful lot more natural with the AI. Um, double clicking into this voice piece as well. You know, one other thing is very important is when you're on Claude um or chat GPT, but Claude is better for it. Just dump a bunch of voice notes in before you do it, say to Claude, "Hey, I'm going to give you a bunch of voice notes on a particular topic. I want you to create like a business case for me on XY Z." And you just and Claude, when I submit them, you're just going to take them and when I say the magic word process, turn it into the document. It's a very effective way of actually getting a bunch of great content out of the AI. just go dump the voice note, dump the voice note, dump the voice note. Better still, do it outside outdoors and have these ideas come to you, submit them, and you're off to the races. So, that's the first pillar of voice to text. Very, very effective. And I think it's so much more important now, particularly what we're seeing with the likes of like if you were in cursor and you're using multi- aents, which I'll show you in a second. You've got lots of agents working for you. You can't keep up with them. We become the bottleneck, right? So, again, voice becomes hugely important for that. Um, so that's really really and and there's another theme as well which I find really helpful um when working with the AI is flipping what I call flipping the script. And so you end up basically have the AI coach out of you the context it thinks it needs to get the job done. What I mean by that is a lot of us kind of go in and we just dump in a bunch of files and context into the AI. But actually what we did was came up with a an idea where we created a prompt that stands up a virtual product manager and a virtual designer and basically you give it a shitty idea very vague idea and then the virtual PM the virtual designer comes in to the chat to ask you clarifying questions a very very effective way and then you just go in through voice answer all the questions and then bump you have the whole PR that's much much better and more solid and rock solid there's also one actually creating a resume right Again, have the prompt ask you for the context from your roles, what did you achieve? So, if you engineer the prompts to become these kind of coaching prompts, again, a really massive unlock for you in terms of how to dance more effectively with the AI. Cool, cool, cool. I'm going to pause there. I don't how these sessions normally work. Are the questions throughout or do I just go and rant throughout the entire bit or or what would you like? Usually we let people rant for, you know, 20 20 30 minutes and um people can drop in questions as they go. Um if if any seem particularly timely, I I I might kind of jump in and and interrupt you and otherwise we'll we'll save them to the end and then we can kind of go into more of an AMA style at the end. >> Okay. Okay. Good. Good. Cool. I'm not going to do too much of the screen sharing, but I'm just going to just talk you through what I kind of what I'm seeing at the moment that's particularly exciting me. So I've been playing with Claude um using Claude talking to and it can be Claude or OpenAI any one of them Gemini so on talking to text files on my computer and so I've designed I've had this PKM system product project management sorry product knowledge management system and what it's doing it's got all of the transcripts for my meetings it's got all my projects it's got all my to-dos it's got my people pages all of that stuff and I've been using Obsidian for this which you may have seen before, but now because those text files are on your computer anyway, if you open up terminal um or you go into say cursor, you can start chatting to those text files, right? You can start saying, well, what do I owe Andrew as a promise? You know, what am I meeting? What what did I last discuss with him in the last project? You can start basically going back and forth on it. That was great for the last eight months for me. Um but the more content, the more meeting transcripts you add in to the system, the more brittle it becomes, right? And so there was a huge concept that came out there recently, probably about a month and a half ago from the team at Every. Every is a media company. Sign up to them. Please follow them if you're not already. And particularly Dan Shipper on Twitter X. And they are seen as the poster child for actually how a modern company should work when it comes to agents and the workflow, right? They came out with a system, an idea, and a concept called compound engineering. Compound engineering is about this idea that the more features you add into your system, the more complex that system becomes, the more costly it becomes to build upon. And so what they've done is they built this plug-in for clawed code that essentially says, well, the more um we build features through AI using cursor and clawed code, the smarter it becomes. Learnings files get created and get injected at the start of another chat. And everybody was like, "Oh my god, this is amazing." And then I was like, hold on a second. From a first principal's point of view, could I apply that to my PKM system? So, could I actually have a self-learning system that actually the more I dance with my person my my my my PKM, it actually starts to learn itself. And so, that was something I applied which I'll show you in a second, which is complete unlock. But one big unlock for me was a thing called hooks from clawed code. Hooks are something that basically listens in um at your chat and there's trigger events. So in claw code which claude is powered by so if you use claude on desktop or web or you're basically using cloud code underneath essentially claude code has these hooks that get triggered by certain things happening in a chat. And so now with hooks which I'll show you in a second, I now have this system that listens in for any feedback I'm giving it. It listens in for any mistakes it's making. It listens in, for example, Claude's developing at such a clip right now, I have a hook that every time I do a daily plan, which you'll see in a second, it goes to Claude's change log and works out what have they released in the last 24 hours, and then the AI comes to me and says, "Dave, based on this knowledge management system that we've been working on together, based on these new capabilities that have just been released, I think we could improve our system if we implement D. Are you okay if I build it? Honest to God. So now my P I don't have to worry and read the bloody blogs anymore about what's happening, right? I've got the whole thing looking at it. I've gone in to cursor and I said, "Oh, by the way, can you also check out the Reddit community for Claude code as well while you're at it?" Thank you. So, you know, it's bonkers, right? What I'm about to show you is this golden opportunity to build out a personal knowledge management system that quite frankly just by having a chat with it, you can get it to do with whatever you want. So I'm going to pause there for a second. Are you okay if I go ahead and demo or >> Yeah, I think that'd be great. I think I think people would love to see see this because it's these things are quite comm you know some people will be deep in claw code I know and others won't have even opened it yet and so I think really seeing it and seeing someone like a power user like you actually use it and navigate around is going to be a real um unlock for some people >> okay and by the way I'm winging this um I haven't done a demo of this at all yet so I'm hoping nothing too um sensitive gets revealed what I might do actually let me just think about it Bear with me. Okay, let me take you into question. Okay, so this is cursor. Cursor um for folk and Nicole is an IDE. There's others available you can use um anti-gravity from Google and so on, but I love cursor and um and there's a free version of this available, right? And so what's great with cursors or the free version um you don't get claude 4.5 opus but you do get sonnet um for a few bits of certain limit usage but honest to god if you pay 20 quid a month for this you're getting clawed in there anyway so I would say if you're weighing up choosing one between the other ditch your claw subscription get your cursor subscription and then use claude in cursor um ideally you might have both in your company um but anyway that's um cursor. And so cursor in here, what you'll see on the left hand side is all of the files I have in my system. But again, like I never even look at that. I don't have to worry with AI where things are going anymore and just let it just file itself away. It knows where everything is for me. And quite frankly, if I look at all this, I'll just get a headache. So I just always just have this all switched off all the time. And now if I was to go in here and say, for example, so what I've got in my system is I've got um company pages. I've got personal pages uh for people internally, externally. I've got projects, I've got to-dos, I've got weekly goals, and that's the kind of the core guts of it right now. But, and again, through voice, I can just say, "Hey, look, um, hey Claude, I'm catching up with Jen today for onetoone. Could you remind me what I promised her and what she promised me? Thank you. Love you." And now what it's going to start doing, it will know my Claude MD file is is says in the Claude MD file. The Claude MD file is the brain of how your Claude works. So every time you do any interaction interaction claude MD with it set of instructions gets invoked um and it says always look for the person's folder to find out which gen day is talking about right and so now it's pulled everything up for me it's got everything there if I do a say what I'm going to do now a daily plan this is a command in cloth so we create many of them and so it's just a hash for sorry forward slash and I've got a whole bunch of different pl uh commands in here. One's a prompt improver. And so again, you can see here what it's doing on the right hand side just it's what it's it's it's coming up it's connected essentially to Anthropic's messages API where I will then give it a ship prompt. It pings it over to Anthropic and then using its prompt improver it basically comes back with a warm peace prompt in return. Now you might think that's really complex to build, but what I'll show you here is the following. Hey Claude, I'm just actually demoing the prompt improver functionality. Can you pretend that we haven't got that in the system right now and let's start from scratch on how to build a prompt improver using anthropics messages API. Right. So I just told you just to forget it has it and now and what I'm demoing to you here is just how easy it is to build all of these kind of capabilities. Okay. So it's starting fresh. >> Dave, did you dictate that with um Super Whisper or something? A third party? >> Yeah, it's FlowVoice.ai I'm using. Um, I'm kind of moving more towards that than Super Whisper. FlowVoice have had a ton more funding recently. In the beginning, I was a big advocate for SuperWisper.com, but with FlowVoice funding, I think it's probably the horse to back because Super Whisper is just a oneman band at the moment. It's a very good product, but I think FlowVoice is um hitting it for me. So, that's exactly it. So what I'll do is I'll go in here now and say okay look can you can you help me create um a command in claude uh that will basically let me take a crappy prompt and then you'll pass it over to the anthropic messages API and return it to me and what you'll do is you'll inject it rather than give me back the actual return prompt you'll inject it back into the chat itself right and that's it you're just having a chat with it and it's now going to create you a command that you can then use um it will ask you for an API I key that you can get and that's it. You're done. It's so so good. Like that's how easy it is to create commands. I went in the other day and um well starts cooking. And by the way, I'm just showing you how you can get different agents running in parallel. So you can have all of these running in parallel at the same time on the right hand side. And that's when your voice becomes important in this kind of a setting, right? Because you need to fire off more and more agents running at the same time. Um, >> yeah. So, it's got >> a couple couple of questions coming in there. A couple of people asking why you're not using clawed voice mode for this. >> Yeah. So, claude voice mode. Um, in here there do you mean this button down the bottom here? To be honest with you, I could do um with FlowVoice, what it does is anytime it pastes something in from a transcription and if I go and edit something because it's actually um you know spelled ED's name wrong or something, I can go in it will then create a learnings file itself and so won't make those mistakes again and again. So basically me using FlowVoice over many different applications in my system that brain itself um just improves far more effectively I find. Cool, cool, cool. >> Great. >> Um, I'm trying to think what else to show you. Like, if I want to create an MCP server, you just literally go in and you have a chat and say, "Hey, can we create an MCP server to access my calendar and make sure that we pull in all my events into my PKM system, you know, every day, and it'll do it for you." So, again, just just use your voice, have a chat. It's not technical at all. It's really really easy uh easy to do. Um I think for people who haven't used MCPS who aren't familiar with them could maybe you could go a little bit deeper on that. Is that is that how you're getting context from your calendar from your conversations into cursor then? >> Yeah. What I'm going to do I just realized I'm going to just go into a fresh install of a cursor in a second because it's just a bit easier to work with. Bear with me. Come back to that question. Okay. All right. This will be this be a better way of demoing. Okay. Right. So we basically now have nothing at all in terms of files in this ED project. So I'll demo from here. It'll be a lot easier. Going back to your question, Ed. So MCP um MCP is kind of souped-up APIs infrastructure and but what's good about it basically it's a better way for AI to work with the content that comes through. Um, if I was to go into Claude here and say, "Hey, can you create a task for me um about this particular project and file it into Ed sometimes because of its probabilistic nature, it might do it different ways every single time I ask for the same question. Whereas when you create a tasks MCP server in here in your instance, it you it can you can work with it to make sure that every time you ask something, the task is written in the same way. It's always, you know, it always goes into the right projects, the right people. And so MCP acts as guard rails to make your system a little bit less well or far less probabilistic and a lot more closer to being deterministic. It will never be foolproof, but MCP is a really, really good way to make sure your system has really strong guardrails for whatever way, for whatever kind of content you're bringing in. Whether that's reading your granola transcripts, whether that's reading your calendar, whether that's reading you playing with tasks, whether that's kind of reviewing your projects, generally always going to have MCP work on that um for any given use case is far more far more effective. Um with that in mind, I'm going to show you how easy this is. So, um, I'd like you to build for me, um, a tool that every Monday morning is going to pull down, um, the latest transcripts from, uh, various different people I follow on YouTube. And then I want you then to extract those transcripts into a daily note. Um, and you'll create a folder for me for where those notes should sit. That will tell me what's new, novel, and contrarian in those transcripts. Right? And this is brilliant, right? some massive unlock this particular piece of capability, right? I I follow about 60 people on YouTube. I don't get to see everybody and now I've got this in my system. It's brilliant. So, it's going to figure out itself what to do. What open-source frameworks could it use? How could we get access to this content? Um, how can we create this automation? I mean, it's bonkers. Um, it asks me questions. Okay, I'm going to build you the transcript analyzer. Okay, it will accept all of this because it's creating stuff on my computer. It's creating the requirements. It's creating Python file. >> Dave, for people's context here, do do you have any kind of technical background at all, engineering background, or do you just kind of uh click the accept tool whenever one pops up? >> Um, I just actually I go they call it yellow. Um, you only live once kind of mode in here, and I haven't got it set up in this particular space, but that's what I do. I accept everything. Um, I just let it go to town. And there are certain settings in cursor. You can say don't make changes to this part of your system and delete everything on your hard drive. But generally speaking, just accept everything and let it go through. Yeah. Hence the whole term vibe coding. It's just like, yeah, whatever. Love you. Just make it happen. Thank you. But yeah. Yeah. Um, and it's brilliant, right? And and so you just the takeaway for everybody here is to get into cursor and and just start creating these workflows, right? How can we process information? What tools do you have access to? And you know, someone said to me the other day, oh well, you know, Granola doesn't have an API. And I was like, well, let's see what the content is stored. All the transcripts are stored in my machine. I can cl code hack it and find out how to try and create it own MCP server. Yeah, no problem, Dave. You know, I it's gone mental. The last three weeks with everything with Claude Hooks and what's possible in here is just um is quite frankly just bonkers. Absolutely bonkers. And people just don't realize. And you know, I'm still trying to get my head around it. Um in terms of what this means for how we how we work, right? How does the system of work itself change, right? How do roles change? What roles actually continue? Um what roles get dropped? What does that mean for our own personal growth, our career trajectory? Where should we be playing? Um I really think the next six months are going to be massively um redefining um because of what we've seen in the last probably three or four weeks from Claude from Anthropic. Um Anthropic just released by the way just related to that which I think is a major milestone is this um new task system. So over Christmas a thing came out recently called Ralph Wigum. Ralph Wigum is a plugin people have heard of. Yeah. And Rwigum what it does essentially is takes a long PRD and creates like a while loop. Um so what it's doing technically essentially is making sure that it creates set of tests to make sure that everything ultimately gets implemented and it just keeps spinning and spinning and spinning and you can say hey look cycle through this PRD like max 40 times to keep your cost down low. We just make sure everything happens and works and people are going away leaving their laptops running overnight and massively complex products are being built. So that took the Twitter sphere as such by storm over um over the last maybe two or three weeks. Ananthropic have brilliantly um come back on that and said no no no no we're going to kill the Ralph and plugin and now we're going to give um essentially like they've created this kind of tasks infrastructure which can sit over sessions. And so when you think about how that could work is like you now have fantastic orchestration at the agent level. agents can now spawn sub agents which can spawn sub sub aents to get all of this work done. Each agent has its own 200k context window which basically gets over this whole context issue that we've been having. And so really in the last you know 72 hours with this release it's fundamentally changed the effectiveness of coding. Um yeah everything is shifting basically a lot in the last month. Um so it's now done this for me. Um, I have no idea what it's done. And someone's going to say to, "Have you created a command for me? How do I use this?" And yeah, and just keep asking questions. Um, here's how I use it. Okay. Well, I don't want to do it that way. I'm not technical. So, okay. Sorry, I'm clicking too quickly. Fine. To get started, do all of this. Find test it. Okay. Now, I want to basically skip all of this, right? So, I don't want to do anything in the terminal. Um, notes. Get Okay, that's perfect. Okay. Okay. I'm a complete idiot. I'm not technical at all. Can you sort all of this technical goblins out for me and um just make sure it all works. Thank you. Love you. Yeah, I mean reviving. Um, now it's running that in the terminal for me, so I don't have to even do it. Brilliant. I mean, yeah, crazy. Uh, it will ask me for an API key. That's one thing I do have to do. So, while that's cooking up, Ed, any other questions as I'm going through? >> Yeah, a couple more questions coming through in the chat. Allison was asking, "Do you need to provide your YouTube account info for it to uh find those uh those people you're following?" >> No, what I've done in my other system was I just gave it a list of all my um all the channel URLs. Um Ed's on there as well. And uh and so yeah, then it went uh it just goes to town that way and then you don't have to give it any API access to your Google account. Um, basically what it does is it takes an RSS feed of Ed's channel and then using some open-source um, code on GitHub for transcript extraction. It then deploys that against Ed's content and brings the content in and then summarize summarizes as as um, podcast. >> And then Michelle's asking if you have any concerns about privacy or your data being uh, accessed by Claude in this way. >> Not at all. No, I mean there's a reason that claude our um or anthropic have such high enterprise penetration. They've actually a year ago I think open AAI had double what anthropic were doing and now it's flipped the other way. Anthropic have now double the penetration of open AI within large enterprise and to me that's like a nice proxy right you know because if you can sell into enterprise and you know they're doing things in the right way from a from a data data point of view I mean I'm on the extreme right I give it my blood counts and I go okay help me what should I see here um you know but again I feel very safe doing it because anthropic are fantastic >> yeah great uh anorag's asking are the URLs delivered via markdown files or do you use markdown files for other instructions. >> Uh what do we um so what do you mean by that? Sorry, can you explain? Sorry. >> Sorry, I meant the meant you mentioned the claude MD files at the start of this. I assumed you meant the markdown files when you mentioned that as the baseline for the instructions. >> Yeah. Uh so the claude MD or claude.m MD is a file that's created within a project and that has then the kind of the brains of how um how I and the AI should work together and what a particular project's about. So if you have a space in cursor um and you have say several projects you do you're working on separately you might want to have one claude MD file that's kind of at a high level for your overall workspace and then a claude MD file that's specific to the project you're working on to tell it what the project's all about and all that kind of thing and where key documentation is and then that's one part of it and then everything that gets created then on the uh left hand side here when it does generate files they will all typically be markdown files in my PKM system here. Obviously, it's created like some other files, but typically um markdown files for knowledge. >> Yeah. Thank you. >> Yeah. And then mark markdown is basically the best the best the best way of giving content to AI really generally. >> Michael's asking if you could give a walk through the other tools you're using beyond claude code and cursor. Are you still using chat GPT, Perplexity, Gemini, any any of those kind of uh general LLMs? Yeah. Um, so perplexity absolutely and quickly share my screen. Just need to tidy up my desktop. One second. Okay. So, show you a few a few of the tricks. This desktop might be a bit too big. Um, is this okay? >> Yeah. Yeah. >> Um, so Perplexity for me, um, absolutely don't use Google anymore. Plexity is amazing. Um, and what's great about it then if you have the app installed, um, you can then just kind of just command it. Um, just doing a a quick shortcut, right? You know, um, what's the weather like in London for the rest of the week? Um, and then it just goes in, right? So it's just a nice quick easy way to get access to anything uh within Perplexity having the command key and then just jumping straight in. So I'm all the way all the time just doing command P command P command P for anything I'm trying to glean. Right. Um another thing as well is if you ever want to kind of extract any knowledge, any insights from Perplexity or any of the AI you're working with, there's a way to extract it as markdown. And I find it really helpful when you're doing like a deep research report, have the markdown extracted and throw that asset into your PKM system and then that's extra fodder for the AI to work with, right? Um, so it's a great way of kind of helping it improve. One of the things I do quite a lot with include and cursor as well, Firecrol, if you haven't used, again, a great tool. Um, you can get, you know, lots of credits for not very much money, but essentially Fire Call is the AI search. I I think it's the tool out there for being able to kind of, you know, look at the internet's corpus of content and pull stuff back to you in an AI friendly way, a markdown friendly way. So what I've done with cursor is I've now integrated firewall MCP server and so anytime I'm doing research, fire call does it for me, brings it back into the chat and I'm like, "Oh, that's amazing. Thank you very much. Now, can you create a markdown file for me, please, and put this into my knowledge?" And again, so again, my system is compounding the more I'm kind of doing all of this research, right? Um, so fire call is another one. Complexity is key. Um, what else? What else am I using? Raycast. I'm using raycast just to navigate and move around my system quite a lot. So raycast, I don't know if people know what raycast is, but essentially it's really cool. So you can go in here and um it gives you access to all your most um commonly used applications, but a whole bunch of like things like you know you can create snippets um where I might kind of say okay if I do double.w and then that will then replace that then with this content. And so there's a lot with Raycast. Have a look at there's great tutorials out there online. Um but yeah, my main use case tends to be kind of go into your clipboard clipboard and uh pull out recent stuff from your clipboard history. But Raycast, again, if you want to be a complete nerd to go down a rabbit hole of productivity. Um raycast definitely have a look at those YouTube videos on raycast. Um what else AI wise? Um, largely I mean that's typically the bulk of it really because I'm doing so much more now these days within cursor. Anytime I'm trying to automate anything, anytime I'm trying to get any kind of content pipeline being pulled together, I will do it all through Cursor and add that into my PM system. So that's kind of where I play most of my time is in there and then having then various different MCP servers to pull stuff together. For example, if I'm going onto a customer call and I will then use Pendo's MCP server. And so we can then pull in usage data from Pendo MCP server. I can look at Granola for all the call transcripts. I can pull in Salesforce and Clary from the sales forecasting point of view. All that comes together into um a company page that I then just get an update on. Um and uh but again that the theme I'm trying to stress here is it's MCP. Fire up as many of them. Think about whatever tools you use in your company and think about is there an MCP server? Hey Claude, there's not. I can't find one any any on GitHub. Let's make one and see what you get. Right? Most of the tools you'll have access to will have API keys. And so try and get the API keys. Tell Claude you have an API key and then create that MCP server. And then say to Claude even like, "Hey Claude, I've got access to Clary. I've got access to Salesforce and I've got access to Granola um and Pendo MCP based on what you know of those MPC MCP servers. And what use cases could we stand up here, Claude, to make my PKM system even better?" Honestly, the amount of rabbit holes you can go down here is quite frankly nuts. >> That's great. Looking at at cursor, is there, you know, lots of people have been posting about claude code um recently? Um, is there a difference between using claude as your model inside cursor and using claude code in the terminal or or or somewhere else or is this all the same thing? Yeah, great great question actually. So the hooks feature that I talked about before um claw claw I think on an onthropic what they're trying to do is get people I think what they're trying to do is get people moving more into the into their CLI for claw code um because that's where they kind of they just want to capture all that value right um me interacting with clawed code through um cursor is just you know they just become a dumb pipe kind of thing right so what they've started doing is things like clawude hook Hux can only run in terminal or the CLI or claude desktop if you have the desktop app installed. So there's lots of good added value that I'm creating through H that if I have a chat with Claude in here, the Hux will not kick in. So I then need to be mindful, it's a bit of a mental juggle of actually when should I be in terminal versus in here. Now, the only reason I play in here in cursor is because I want these multi- aents because I might be firing up lots of different things to work across my PKM system at the same time, which you can't easily do uh well, you can't do in terminal or in um or claw so easily. What you could do, I guess just having said that, you could have different terminal windows open up at the same time for different tasks, but again, just becomes a bit messy. So, yeah, it's a bit of a bit of both is the short answer. And depending on what I'm doing, if I want the system to be learning as I'm working with it on a particular project, I'll go into terminal. And if it's just kind of, you know, quickly kind of running through all my projects and understanding where I'm at with them, I'll kind of fire up multiple agents and cursor. >> Great. And and you can just create a kind of a what is it a claude file in in any local folder then and if you're using Claude and it's in that workspace, it will start reading those instructions and that that's your kind of baseline kind of uh system prompt. >> Yeah. Yeah, exactly that. Exactly that. And you know a good thing to do, let me just actually maybe I'll just pull up my cloud MD file actually. See what's in there. I haven't looked at it in ages. Hopefully there's nothing too embarrassing in there. >> May maybe we can zoom in a little bit because this is quite quite small. >> Yeah. Sorry. After this I'll stop hugging the conversation because I see there's a bunch more questions that popped up in the chat. >> That's cool. I'll share in a Okay, a quick scan. Just make sure it's okay. Uh, can you pull up the claud file within my Claude Cydian folder, please? Um, >> even if you like I just got this wrong. It said in filter. I don't know how it got that. But it will still, you don't have to beware perfect with your AI at all. I mean, I'm sure everyone knows that right now. It does forgive quite well. Um, okay. So, let me show you what it's got in here. Just going to open this in preview mode. Okay. So, it's kind of got a roll a kind of overview like what is what is the system all about? Who is Dave? You know, what the folder structure is. This is great because every time now you go chat to Claude um with this knowledge in there, the Claude MD file gets invoked. So it knows exactly where to find things, right? So that's really that's the first key principle there. It's really really important. Look at these session start behaviors. The minute I start a session in here, it's going to check to see if um a day a daily digest for my YouTube intel has been created or not. If it doesn't, it's then going to run the full pipeline. All of this code it's created. have got no idea what's in here. But that's how you pull together all the YouTube transcripts. Um, if uh a daily digest exists but there's some pending remain uh videos remain to process, just basically sort everything out. News newsletter intel, same thing. If a daily digest has not been created, automatically run at session start um the intel on all your newsletters that you're following. Same for granola. So again, this cloud MD file knows exactly what to do every time I start with it. Okay. Um, LinkedIn intel. I've got this thing actually. Ed, you might be interested in this. Um, this might be too. Um, I use Phantom Buster to follow to find out my latest followers on LinkedIn. And if anyone's VP level plus, let me know because I want to see if I can help my sales team um, do a do a pitch in there to uh, to that company. Um, all my gong recordings momentum we call it now here that we have um, etc. Now, this is where it gets really interesting. So, now um, flawed code. So basically we run this um script every day to have a look at claw code and the claw code Reddit community and all of the blog and the change log and tell me like how we can actually be using claw code in more effective ways. It's got some content I generate idea generation based on all the intel from the market. So again all this is getting set up at start of every single day. So I'll keep going on. Um then core behaviors right you know what you want typically in terms of how it to behave challenge ideas build on other ideas automatically update people's person pages right and when significant context about that person is shared um and then this is the golden one silent learning capture you know every time there's a mistake that's been made by the AI there's a gap in documentation or you've seen a pattern in how Dave works you know basically silently improve append that to the session learnings files And then that session learnings file will basically go into um another command which then says okay well we've made a few cockups this week like how how can we improve the system right? Um so yeah so it's just um it's just really really really really really good. It's really really good. And what I'm doing, like I say, this podcast I'm coming out today, coming out with actually on Thursday, uh will be essentially the chunk, the bulk of what we have here, I'm showing you here today, um will be available in a GitHub repo that I'll be calling Dex. Um and I'll be giving that out to uh those that follow me um so that we can um share this and get other people up up and running as quickly as possible because there's an awful lot of good content about using clawless PPM systems. Um, but there's very little out there that actually helps people get running with it um very very quickly and that's hopefully what that repo will be. Cool. Uh, a few more questions uh in in the chat, Dave. So, uh, Alexa is asking or actually a couple people are asking this if it's possible to use Notion as your kind of like main repository for documents or if you have to use Obsidian or or your kind of local folders. >> I'm not using Notion. Um and uh yeah, I use Obsidian because it's all text files on my machine and it's just easier for um this then to access it. Yeah, otherwise you'll be doing everything in Notion itself. I haven't played with Notion much lately. I did meet someone recently who said they can do most of what I'm talking about in notion. I find that hard to believe. Um but notion obviously have come on a long way recently um in what they're doing, but I don't know enough about it to yeah to say to say to what extent you could replicate most of this in there. Did could you connect notion to to cursor to lord code? >> I don't believe so. I don't think they you make that that contents made available. It's not on your machine locally. So yeah, I won't be able to read it locally. >> Yeah. Um Saga's asking about claude co-work. Uh do you have a view on this and where this might go? >> Yeah, I think for people that want access and the same principles, right? You can just go in there and access all your files and give it access to a folder and it can do stuff. But what you what then becomes hard right is that those automations that's nothing that you can do easily within co-work at all. Um so I couldn't have like it running and processing all my intel from newsletters and from YouTube and bringing things in from clar and from momentum and you know Salesforce with MCP servers. None of that's going to work. It's just going to work with flat text files, which is useful, but you're missing the trick in terms of the automation and having a system that learns over time, improves over time, and becomes far better to partner with you as you dance with it every other day. But absolute genius move. I think you know what they and and open AI are trying to do now is get more into enterprise use cases and moving away increasingly so from non-engineering use or towards non-engineering use cases and and get into enterprise. So, I think it's um I think it's we'll see a lot more from them on that, but it's been bonkers. Like, they only built that they built that in one and a half weeks. It's crazy, right? Um again, using concepts like the Ralph Wickham plugin and all the secret sauce that they got built internally. So, it's um this is the world we're in, right? And um yeah, to build something like that within such a short space of time is quite frankly bonkers. >> Yeah. Yeah. Super. I think it's such an interesting space there. Simon's asking if you've got any top tips for creating agents that represent um you know particular roles within a team like product managers, business analysts, um that sort of thing. >> Yeah, brilliant. Um 100%. So, thanks for bringing this up. I brought that up. Sorry, I forget the name. The I was going to the shops the other day and I wanted to write this article that shall be posting about my setup and it's quite a lengthy article. So what I found was I had the AI look at my read me file and my entire codebase to kind of work with the kind of a start to pretend article and I wanted to give it some feedback and as I gave it feedback the article went off the rails. The AI just took it apart and it just got worse and worse and worse and I was like oh can we go back to version one please? So I was like hold on a second. So I went claude on mobile. I said, "Hey, Claude Dave here. I'm going to describe a bunch a bunch of work I need done uh when I'm creating articles, and I want you to come up with a fantastically rich agent and sub agent architecture for me uh that I can then create a PRD and then give this into Claude uh to build out the um agent infrastructure." My god, it created 22 sub agents all doing different things like all looking at the same article, all running in parallel with their own 200k context windows. And so one was like for the overall arc, one was for, you know, just like how novel this is. One was for clarity, one was for like, you know, unbelievable. And then I got back into it and go, yeah, that's okay. Can I have a few more agents, please? What else can we do? Just here's some more agents for you, Dave. So, um, yeah, look into it because you can like if you describe and again that trick, right, claude mobile voice notes what who these people are, right? what these jobs to be done are then it will come up with its own optimal um agent infrastructure for you um and it's just fascinating to watch um because it's just uh ever so powerful the quality now I now run my article through the review article um agent and it's just like it takes three minutes but my god it's like boom it's great it's more successful as a result >> amazing I don't know if other people have questions please do um stick them in the chat and we'll get round to them um as quickly as possible. Dave, another kind of question from me like you a lot of work in organizations is you know it's social it's with other people you're kind of collaborating on documents and things like that. Does your does your system with Claude allow you to kind of like work on those shared documents um or is this purely like a personal kind of productivity system? >> Yeah. Um the short answer is if team so my team here at Pendo um are kind not yet doing what I'm doing. Um so yeah we all be kind of Google Docs and what have you. So sometimes if it's a doc to work on I'll just take a copy of it. Um for um I'm not too sure which version I know for the free version of Google Docs you can't um select all copy as markdown um but my version you can. And so if you are ever seeing the ability to copy or paste as markdown always use that when you're playing with the AI because then those tables you have in the Google doc all that gets brilliantly kind of carried across into the chat. And then once you then update it and then you can then carry it back paste in as markdown. So yeah, it's a bit of kind of copy and paste for me at the moment. Um but um but yeah, I'm still flying at a region of nuts quite frankly. Yeah. >> Yeah. Awesome. Um Michael's asking, it seems you can have your your personal AI budget exceed $100 or $200 a month for so many tools. Um you know, you're paying for replet for coach HGBT. Any advice here? What what's do you do you know what you're spending on AI tools at the moment on a on a monthly basis Dave? >> My husband does. He's not very happy. I'm spending about I think about 90 pounds personally a month. Um but what I'm doing increasingly is a lot of the tools now I have um one I was using recently and I talked about before was sama.com in my AI presentation in ProCon. It's a tool that lets you block out your calendar not just for for meetings but for the work you want to get done. Um and uh I was paying 20 quid a month for it and basically went to claw code one morning spun up an agent and said hey can you have a look at the help page documentation extract it all down through fire call give me the jobs to be done create PRDS for all the features and then I apply the Ralph Wigan plugin on the whole thing the whole thing got built by by lunchtime and I now cancel my 20 quid a month subscription so um you know that works for software that you're subscribed to that can typically be built by the um AI and when it comes to hey can you build me a version of Riplet well no um so but honest ly I don't think you need a plit. think um claw code really honestly it's the one to watch particularly with the new task orchestration capability that they've released recently um the Ralph Wigum kind of thing um you can build pretty much what you need I think in claw code so I would go in all in on claude is my key thing I'm not being sponsored by them I've been a fan of them for over a year now but they're definitely the team to watch I think they're gonna yeah them and Gemini >> just oh sorry go on >> no no no sorry you go for it Dave Um I've just something else like should we do a bit of vibe coding as well? >> Yeah, let's do a bit of that. >> Okay. Okay. Let you finish what you want to say then. >> Oh, I was just saying I I'd seen it. I actually saw a webinar last week where um a company was talking about having gone like all in on kind of multi- aent coding. Uh so a bit like Dave but but writing code. They'd written 300,000 lines of code in six weeks and they said that engineers were spending um $1,000 a month on tokens um just just for building. So their view was that everyone's going to spend a lot more on on uh AI tools uh very shortly. >> Yeah. Yeah. 100%. Um so yeah being asked in the chat would you drop Chappie Chachi favorite Claude? I abs 100% yes um because of what they're doing the 4.5 is a fantastic model opus in terms of reasoning but from a coding point of view um it's just really they're really really really on fire and you're seeing the pace of execution there I think um open AI JPT that company is kind of trying to it's a bit lost in terms of where it can play um and I think yeah definitely um Anthropic have um have have definitely got an awful lot more behind them um so yeah if you're looking to replace it definitely go clawed. Um, so let me talk you uh through VIP coding. Um, so this is bonkers as well, right? So I just mentioned like how I managed to get the AI to kind of look at the help pages of a product and and build it for me. Um, what's great now is that you can just bring your ideas so much more easily to life now. And so I did an episode on this, episode seven of the VIP PM. Have a look at it because it is quite it's quite bonkers. What I do now from a vibe coding point of view is I'll go into um I'll start in Gemini typically. Um you don't have to you can start wherever you want to start like lovable is also fine. Um and so I'll go in and what's great now is when you want to go and build in AI studio um you can essentially let's just change some stuff. Let me just say bear with me. Okay. So, they have Yeah. Okay. They put it down here. So, so what's So, I typically will go into AI Studio or Lovable, build the guts of an app, and have back and forth with it. I do choose AI Studio over loable because you haven't got the full power. what Google are up to with Gemini. So whether it's kind of bringing in kind of speech to text, whether it's kind of, you know, animating images with video, it's a whole bunch of different capabilities, nana banana that you now can bring in quite easily into your app to get it off the ground. And it's good also coming back with other suggestions to extend your idea forward. When you've then got that to a point where you are say um all good, then what I would typically do is think I'm in the wrong. Okay. over here then to take it up to GitHub. So when you take it up to GitHub um then you take that up to GitHub, push it up to your GitHub repo and then what you should be doing is then when you go into cursor there too many screens I should share my full screen again. Sorry, might be easier. Um and then when you open up a new session in cursor uh then you go in here and you basically clone the repo. So you put the URL in, it pulls it down, then you're off to the races because then you got Claw then to work on top of the of the idea, right? It's synced with your repo. You can start spinning up multiple agents that you can't do in Lovable, you can't do in Gemini, and then you can start really rapidly iterating on your ideas. So from a vibe coding point of view, uh I think that approach works really really well. Gemini and Lovable are good at getting the guts of your product pulled together, but then when you want to really start then building on it, um at pace, uh do do that trick. It's very very effective. I was um I don't know if I can show it to you. I'll see if I can find it. But I was going down to a conference in Oakland to present on KPI driver trees. Most organizations don't have them. At last recently said that 12% of product managers feel disconnected from dollar outcomes at board level. Um and so I thought, hey, why do we build a KPI driver tree? Let me pull it up for you. It's bonkers. And it literally just took about I kid you not um about an hour and a half to to pull together. and see if I can find it. I'll actually ed you can maybe share it with the people afterwards. Um, but what I wanted to show you was just this idea of being able to Yeah, might be this is it. Cool. Um so what it did was basically take and this is how the point here sorry stepping back storytelling is the most important thing we do as part of people and we need to be and now we can better storyt tell right to get people aligned with their ideas and so yeah we built this whole thing in about an hour and a half where it would look at a particular company's publicly available information and then pull together what we think a KPI driver tree could be for that company and then how we could use Pendo to push on those metrics and connect them to dollar outcomes. But it was so easy, right? And then from there um we were able to then like go down the ladder, explain, understand everything. Um and this where became quite powerful this trick I wanted to show you was doing a red team analysis. So AI is probabilistic. And so the first pass of it's always going to be a little bit ropey. And so now with red teaming, you have the AI tell the AI off. So the AI looks at the metrics that it came up with and said, "That was bloody stupid, you idiot. and then comes up as something really really good. You just accept everything and then it pulls it back in. So always my point here have always like hey AI can you please red team this for me and it will just rip itself to shreds and come up with something far far more solid. Um it's very very powerful. But the point here is like look at what workflow you have on your organization and just have chats with cursor uh or with Gemini or lovable and try and replicate them where you can because it is so so easy and particularly when you get those multi- aents working together in parallel you'll have something built very very quickly indeed. >> That's awesome. We I know we're nearly out of time. We've just got two more questions I think um which are in the chat. So why don't we answer those and then we'll we'll wrap up. So, um, Alex is just asking, uh, you know, what's the best way to start out? She's trying to keep costs low. Um, but you know, she's got lots of ideas. Like, do you have any kind of tips tips there? Yeah, Cursor Pro, um, for $20 a month. That will give you an awful lot to go with. Um, so I definitely just that should be your first takeaway. Um, and then go in uh to cursor and just um I'll have a repo out on Thursday called Dex. I'll be sharing my VIPM podcast and that will then give you infrastructure and kind of scaffolding to get going with the self-learning system uh that I just been discussing in my system and I'll be sharing that with the wider community on Thursday afternoon uh UK time and yeah just start playing with it right and then just start having chats talk talk talk download if you can afford it FlowVoice as well. Um, you got a free version of FlowVoice, play with it, and once you hit your ceiling, obviously that means you want it. So, go and go pay for that as well. It'll pay for itself in dividends. >> Super. And then Tim's asking, how do you share and collaborate with colleagues your workflows and tools um so they can use the same same things. >> Yeah, really interestingly, I mentioned to our executive at Pendo and there's a huge opportunity to take like this repo, right, that I have I'll be sharing on Thursday, but creating one for our company at Pendo. And so you can imagine like it has all the context, all the knowledge, all the kind of you know where we're going, all our OKRs, it has everything and because people clone it, right? All the knowledge of how Pendo itself works. Everything's in there and then all of these commands we think you might need in your role. You can even imagine having that repo unfurl itself differently for someone like Ed or someone like Andrew who's working in different parts of the organization. And so I think if it was me running my company, I would have a repo of something like this PKM system tailored for each function in my organization. And then that becomes the consistent brain with which people partner with the AI on. >> Awesome. >> Yeah. I think that's what we'll see this year. Yeah. >> Yeah. I mean, I I'm also kind of very bullish on this kind of whole way of working I think is going to explode over the next um year, year or two. Um Dave, this has been fantastic. Thank you so much for your time. Um, I've stuck your LinkedIn URL uh in in the chat and we'll be sending people a quick follow-up uh email just with that link and uh as I say a link to the recording uh of this as well. Um, but thank you so much for for coming on and sharing your your wisdom and expertise with us. It's always like fascinating and inspiring um to see what you're doing. >> Thank you. An absolute privilege and I'm a huge fan of what you do and thank you for doing what you do for the community. Too bad. All right. See you soon. Bye.
