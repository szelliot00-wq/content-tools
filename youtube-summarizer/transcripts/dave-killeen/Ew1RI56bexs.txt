Hi there! We do not have enough time in our day. So I'm here to save you and your team time through tooling. Yes, I kid do not! I'm an absolute two freak for my sins and much to my husband's frustration actually... I once tried to get our builders into Trello, to no avail Sadly. But I do genuinely believe that particularly what we're seeing right now with a suite of new AI tooling coming onto the market. That the right set of tooling can get you and your teams into a far deeper state of flow than you would otherwise be able to do without them. So in this short video, I'm going to start with use case. I find 'hair in the arms' - speech to text If you're like the rest of us and you find yourself having to react to other people's agendas and you're frantically getting back to people on email and Slack between meetings all day long. Then this is what you should be watching. So there are two tools on this demo. One super, super simple. You got a short book, a text in your head. You want to get on to computer as quickly as possible, press a button on your keyboard and 'bump' in it goes Magical. Lovely, but more or less comes out how you want it. And the other is when you have a longer form piece of content that you want to verbally pass into your computer and then have an LLM that the software provides to you actually massage that based in a prompt instruction that you have in the app. Sounds a little complicated. It isn't, don't worry. Lean-in. Let's dive in. Okay. So here's the first of two demos. This one is super simple. As I mentioned before, the use case for this particular app is when you have a blob of text in your head and it's very, well-structured, you know, pretty much exactly what you want to say. So you don't need AI to step in and reformat restructure it. You just want to get it down as quickly as possible, far, far faster than you can do typing. So what I do is I activate my Hotkey and I'll go with the following. Hi, David. It was great to see you at the iconic venture summit last week in Venice. What a lineup that was and what an honor it was to see Roger. I mean, Jeff. Rothschild. I hope you found the event useful. Look forward to seeing you next week. Cheers, Dave. That will go in pretty quickly. Iconic is in my dictionary was spelt with a Q it's, a VC firm. All capitals it has picked that up. Venice. I deliberately put that in wrong. I wish it was in Venice. It was in London. And then what I did is also, I got Jeff initially wrong. I said, actually it was Roger, but I corrected it saying, can you please correct in my sentence? And it took all that, but actually ignored my instructions in here. So now what you see as Jeff. What I want to do is I'm going to say. Flow - Venice, can you replace that with London, please? And then that will do that for me. And then. Flow. Can you change this into the style of Steve jobs? Thanks. And then BOOM! Done! It's brilliant. Honestly, you'll be working at lightning pace  with this thing. So now let's move on to Superwhisper Superwhisper is fantastic. It allows you to create these different transcription modes. So you might be writing an email or having the AI turn your meeting transcription into some published meeting notes, or you might be reaching out to a potential customer or reviewing your week. and planning for the week ahead. All through voice. Whatever mode you want. You can create in Superwhisper You just give each mode, the instructions on how to take your fuzzy voice and turn it into the format and the structure that you want using the AI. Creating a mode super simple. You go in here. It's an email mode. Create it. You're done. How a mode is unstructured is you have a language model and you've got a voice model. The voice model is what takes my gobbledygook, Irish accent, and miraculously turns it into text and then I pass it onto the language model. And you've got a choice of various different models that you can use over here. You can download them locally and you're given a trade-off of speed versus accuracy, and you can pick whichever one works for you. Language models, same thing. You can then have their texts and throws it up against the language model. And based on the prompt that you have, it will then give you the output and the structure, the format that you're asking the AI to generate for you. This is brilliant. It gives you a whole ton of flexibility. So Superwhisper works in desktop, just like it does with Flow. The difference here is you get these different modes for your different jobs to be done, depending on what kind of content you're trying to get out into your computer as quickly as possible and how you want it massaged. But also hair on the arms, it comes with an iOS keyboard. It's brilliant. So you're going for a walk. You want to get your thoughts out in different modes - you might be ideating on something you might be kind of writing up the review, whatever it might be. You can then just talk to it and again, choose your prompt and all that copy. Then you save to clipboard share it into wherever you want it to go. I sincerely hope that we'll we just go through together and last four minutes will save you a ton of days in the next few months. An exec that I was working with recently, said that these two tools alone have saved him one day a week. Bonkers. So this kind of content resonates with you. Please do give it a thumbs up, but it'll give me some sense that this kind of content is worth me investing my time and effort into. And if so, I will be sharing a lot more content over the weeks ahead. That will be all around tooling. To help you and your team save time. Take care. Thank you.
