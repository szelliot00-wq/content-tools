## Summary
Oxygen AI Positron 8.1 has been released, integrating OpenAI's GPT-5.2 and GPT-5.2 Thinking models into the Oxygen XML suite to transform XML authoring. This update shifts from simple AI assistance to an agentic, orchestrated experience, featuring a new "Planner" chat mode for managing complex, project-wide transformations. The release also introduces sensitive data masking for enhanced security, alongside various improvements for efficiency, customization, and document handling.

## Key takeaways
- **Next-Generation AI Integration:** Leverages OpenAI's cutting-edge GPT-5.2 and GPT-5.2 Thinking models, replacing older versions like GPT-4, to power complex, multi-step agentic tasks.
- **Agentic "Planner" Mode:** Introduces a sophisticated "Planner" chat mode that intelligently manages resource-intensive, project-wide operations (e.g., document conversions, translations) by proposing multi-step plans and delegating to specialized AI agents, effectively bypassing traditional LLM context limits.
- **Built-in Sensitive Data Masking:** Enhances security and privacy by automatically identifying and masking Personally Identifiable Information (PII) before requests reach the LLM, with seamless restoration in the AI's response.
- **Optimized Efficiency and Cost Reduction:** Features prompt engineering improvements that significantly reduce token consumption, leading to lower operational costs for users.
- **Extensive Customization Options:** Provides a new tools selector, support for custom chat modes, and vision capabilities for image analysis, allowing users to tailor AI behavior to specific needs.
- **Enhanced Document Processing:** Improves handling of PDF and Word documents by preserving their internal structure (headings, tables, styles) for more precise analysis and conversion.
- **Integrated Review Workflow:** Enables direct review and management of AI-modified files within the chat interface, offering precise control over accepted changes.
- **Expanded AI Toolset:** Adds new AI tools for command-line operations, resource management (copy/move/rename), and directory listing, enabling the AI to perform a wider range of complex tasks.
- **Broad Product Availability:** The Oxygen AI Positron 8.1 plugin is available across the entire Oxygen XML suite, including Editor, Author, Developer, JSON Editor, Web Author, and Content Fusion.
