## Summary
Oxygen AI Positron 8.1, a plugin for the Oxygen XML suite, has been released, integrating OpenAI’s advanced GPT-5.2 and GPT-5.2 Thinking models to transform XML authoring into an agentic, orchestrated experience. The standout feature is the "Planner Chat Mode," which allows the AI to develop and execute multi-step, project-wide transformations by delegating tasks to specialized agents, thereby moving beyond simple AI assistance. This update also introduces critical enhancements like sensitive data masking for privacy, improved efficiency, customizable AI tools, and advanced document handling.

## Key takeaways
- **Next-Generation AI Intelligence:** Integrates OpenAI's GPT-5.2 and GPT-5.2 Thinking models, replacing older versions, to deliver state-of-the-art AI capabilities.
- **Agentic Multi-Step Workflows via "Planner":** The new "Planner Chat Mode" enables the AI to propose and execute complex, project-wide operations (e.g., translating entire folders, DITA map transformations) by breaking them down into multi-step plans and delegating to specialized AI agents, overcoming traditional LLM context limits.
- **Enhanced Data Privacy and Security:** Introduces built-in Sensitive Data Masking to automatically identify and mask PII (e.g., email addresses, API keys) before requests reach the LLM, with seamless restoration in the AI's response.
- **Optimized Efficiency and Cost Reduction:** Prompt engineering improvements significantly reduce token consumption, leading to lower operational costs for high-volume users.
- **Increased Customization and Control:** Users can tailor AI behavior through a new tools selector to enable/disable specific AI tools, create custom chat modes, and leverage vision support for image analysis.
- **Expanded AI Capabilities:** New tools for command-line operations, resource management (copy/move/rename), and directory listing give the AI more functionalities to accomplish complex tasks.
- **Improved Document Handling and Review:** Attached PDF and Word documents now preserve their internal structure, and users can review and manage AI-modified files directly within the chat interface.
