# Andrej Karpathy talks about "Claws"

Source: https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/21/claws/

## Summary
Andrej Karpathy is exploring "Claws," a new layer in the AI stack that builds upon LLM agents by enhancing orchestration, scheduling, context, tool calls, and persistence. He acquired a Mac Mini specifically to tinker with these systems, which he believes are an "awesome, exciting new layer." "Claw" is emerging as a term of art for agent systems like OpenClaw, characterized by running on personal hardware, communicating via messaging, and capable of both direct action and task scheduling.

## Key takeaways
- Andrej Karpathy is enthusiastically investigating "Claws" as the next evolutionary step beyond LLM agents, highlighting their potential to improve AI system orchestration and persistence.
- "Claws" define a new category of AI agent systems, often running on personal hardware, utilizing messaging protocols, and capable of both direct instruction execution and task scheduling.
- A diverse ecosystem of "Claw" implementations is rapidly emerging (e.g., NanoClaw, nanobot), suggesting active development and interest in this new paradigm.
- Karpathy is credited with identifying and popularizing "Claw" as the definitive terminology for these advanced agent systems, much like his previous influence on terms like "agentic engineering."
