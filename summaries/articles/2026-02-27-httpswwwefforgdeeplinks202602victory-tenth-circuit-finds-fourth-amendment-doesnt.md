## Summary
The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the Fourth Amendment does not permit broad, suspicionless searches of electronic devices belonging to individuals arrested at a protest. This significant victory for privacy rights affirms that law enforcement cannot conduct "sweeping digital rummages" through protesters' phones and other devices without particularized probable cause, even if the individuals were arrested for minor offenses like obstructing traffic. The ruling sets a precedent protecting demonstrators' digital privacy from generalized fishing expeditions by the police.

## Key takeaways
- The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed that the Fourth Amendment requires particularized probable cause for searches of electronic devices, even for individuals arrested at protests.
- Law enforcement cannot conduct broad, suspicionless searches ("sweeping digital rummages") of protesters' digital devices without specific justification, rejecting the argument that arrest alone justifies such a search.
- This ruling is a significant victory for digital privacy rights, especially for protesters, reinforcing protections against overly broad digital surveillance by the police.
- The court's decision emphasizes that Fourth Amendment protections extend to digital content on devices, preventing authorities from treating them as open for inspection merely due to an arrest.
