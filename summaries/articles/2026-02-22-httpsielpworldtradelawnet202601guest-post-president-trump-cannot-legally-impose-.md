## Summary
The article argues that Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 does not legally authorize a U.S. President to impose tariffs. It contends that the provision was specifically enacted to address temporary, severe balance-of-payments deficits and is fundamentally distinct from other trade laws designed for general trade policy or protectionist measures. Its legislative history and language confirm its narrow purpose, making any broader application for tariffs an unlawful expansion of presidential authority.

## Key takeaways
- Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 is intended solely to address serious U.S. balance-of-payments deficits, not general trade policy or protectionism.
- The authority granted under Section 122 is temporary and strictly conditional on the existence of a severe balance-of-payments problem.
- Legislative history indicates that Section 122 was a response to the collapse of the Bretton Woods system and concerns about the U.S. dollar, not a broad grant of power for imposing tariffs on specific goods or countries.
- Utilizing Section 122 for purposes other than a balance-of-payments crisis would constitute an unlawful expansion of presidential trade authority.
- Other U.S. trade laws (e.g., Sections 201, 232, 301) are designed to address specific trade issues and impose tariffs under defined conditions, underscoring Section 122's distinct and limited scope.
