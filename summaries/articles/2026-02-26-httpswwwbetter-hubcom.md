# Show HN: Better Hub – A better GitHub experience

Source: https://www.better-hub.com/

## Summary
Bereket, founder of Better Auth, has launched "Better Hub," an alternative interface designed to significantly improve the GitHub experience. Frustrated by GitHub's current UI/UX and lack of direct improvements, he developed a prototype that he and his team now use daily. Better Hub focuses on a UI/UX rethink, keyboard-first workflows, context-aware AI integration, and introduces new concepts like Prompt Requests and self-healing CI, all built on Next.js and GitHub APIs.

## Key takeaways
- **Motivation:** Better Hub was created out of personal frustration with the current GitHub experience, particularly the UI/UX and the lack of innovation in core features.
- **Core Goal:** To offer a "better GitHub experience" by re-imagining the interface and workflow, aiming to improve collaboration without replacing GitHub itself.
- **Key Features & Improvements:**
    - **UI/UX Rethink:** Redesigned repo home, PR review, and overview pages prioritizing "signal over noise," faster navigation, and clearer structure.
    - **Keyboard-First Workflow:** Implements extensive keyboard shortcuts (e.g., ⌘K for command center, ⌘/ for global search, ⌘I for an AI assistant named "Ghost").
    - **Context-Aware AI Integration:** AI that understands the specific repo, PR, and diff being viewed.
    - **New Concepts:** Introduction of "Prompt Requests," "self-healing CI," and "auto-merge with automatic conflict resolution."
- **Technical Implementation:** Built as a Next.js server interacting with the GitHub API, utilizing heavy caching and local state management.
- **Current Status & Vision:** It's an ambitious and early-stage experiment aimed at exploring what a modern code collaboration experience could look like, with potential future considerations for optional git hosting.
- **Community Engagement:** The founder is actively seeking feedback from the community on desired GitHub improvements.
