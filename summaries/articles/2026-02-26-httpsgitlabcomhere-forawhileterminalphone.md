## Summary
TerminalPhone is a self-contained Bash script enabling anonymous, end-to-end encrypted voice and text communication between two parties. It functions like a walkie-talkie, where voice messages are recorded, compressed, encrypted, and sent as single units over the Tor network. This tool requires no server infrastructure, accounts, or phone numbers, using a Tor hidden service .onion address as the sole form of identity.
