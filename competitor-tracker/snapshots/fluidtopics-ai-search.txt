The best of keyword and semantic search
Precision keyword search

tf-idf
and
Lucene
and offers unique and tunable relevance.
Natural language search
If you’re unsure what to type, our semantic search engine allows you to interact naturally in everyday language, understanding intent and context beyond the exact words used, in any language. By leveraging advanced embeddings model combined with fine-tuned vector-based similarity search, it delivers consistently accurate, reliable, and trustworthy results.
Customization and business rules
